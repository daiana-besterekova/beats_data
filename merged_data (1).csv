R1JWJ95BYVWRD0,B0C2W1KLSS,"5.0 out of 5 stars An alternative to AirPod Pros? Yes, but with a slight lower quality difference. Worth it? Yes",Matthew Martínez,5,"I compared these beats with AirPod pros. Both are Apple products.The beats have a smaller range of volume, the lowest volume is pretty loud for the “lowest volume”. Each level for volume going up is minimal compared to the AirPods. (At around 1/3 of the volume they match volume. AirPods get a lot quieter and ALOT louder, I’d say 10% louder) The beats are loud enough for me I leave it at 3/4 of volume.Noise cancellation is really good, some noise filters through in loud environments but it’s enough when you’re at the gym and busy places. I experienced noise filtering through when I was in a car with music blasting. So I’d rate the noise cancellation pretty high.Pass through, pass through is good. I’d recommend not having the pass through when there’s lots of noise cause it’s good and personally it can get loud. When there’s a sudden loud noise the earbuds make the same loud noise and it could hurt your ears if you have sensitive hearing.Cons, when in loud environments if you are on a call the earbuds filter out the noise, and when you speak it filters your voice a bit too which makes it hard for the other person on the other end to hear you. Also the bit about the loud noise with the pass through and sensitive ears is a con for me.Battery life is really good, lasts me my work day and a bit more, I’m sure like all batteries that would go down after use but hasn’t happened to me yet I’ve had it for 2 months now.Bluetooth, the Bluetooth is pretty strong. You could probably still have a connection a few rooms away in a house before the connection begins to fail. Unlike AirPods when you remove the bud from an ear whatever is playing will not pause unless YOU pause it. This means it’s constantly connected, when you are within the Bluetooth radius of course. I’ve lost a bud twice but this actually helped me find it, so that’s a plus. And with these beats you cannot connect another pair to your phone like you can with AirPods. So it’s only on pair of beats at a time.I really like the earbuds and I think they are well worth the price, to me they are a barely lesser version of AirPod pros. I’m considering getting the studio pro’s over the AirPod max after this experience.Update 4 months later- The battery life is still very strong, I have had some issues with them disconnecting and reconnecting to my phone and I believe it’s because when I got my Apple Watch, it must be Confusing the connection between my phone and the watch. Yes, it can be annoying but to me, it’s still worth it. All really need to do is reconnect with my phone. I don’t think AirPods Will have this problem. But I’m not sure. There was one day where the noise cancellation on my right earbud stopped working, but it’s because I didn’t have enough battery so I had to charge it after that I had no issues.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2024",AFPNLCKHE6UN5JN6M77MOHLXXGGA,1,61,Color: IvoryStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
R2BD35HL2C6JSK,B0C2W1KLSS,5.0 out of 5 stars Read this Review (I'll tell you why I settled on these after researching for months!),Tuck VB,5,"You're probably like me, dragging your feet for months, researching and researching for hours trying to compare brand names (Bose, or JBL? Sennheiser, or Apple?). I finally settled on these, and here's why:1) I didn't want airpods. You probably also don't want airpods (if you're even reading this review). Not because of the quality, but because ""everyone has airpods"" and they're ""airpod people"" (sorry to all the airpod people, including my sister). I wanted to be different (hopefully no shame there?).2) My top priority was phone calls with my earbuds (make sure, even if you don't end up with these earbuds, that you determine your priorities, -clearly-). These earbuds have some of the best ""in ear"" calling I've seen (next to airpods).3) I wanted something low profile (also why I didn't want airpods with the ""stem""). These are very sleek, and don't look flashy in the ear. They're also not very cumbersome, and fit very snuggly. Very light, but durable - great design, even better build quality.4) Not a huge selling factor for me personally, but if you want noise cancellation, this is your stop. I just used these this morning on the train coming into Boston, sitting next to the door leading out of the coach, and was astonished with how adaptive it was to specifically tuning out the rattling of the train. These earbuds will adapt to the environments around them!5) The battery life is fantastic. Keep in mind, if you're in a loud area with the noise cancelling on, and it's working harder, you're going to blow through your battery faster - even that considered, I was still really impressed with the battery life!6) This is clearly designed to work seamlessly with Apple products. Pairing was a breeze, and the connectivity is strong. Beats and Apple had a beautiful handshake with this product, and it shows.7) Lastly, the sound quality. This is unmatched with anything I've used prior. Has very clear audio, and a great range of tone. The bass is powerful, while balancing defined treble tones.A couple things to consider:-These don't have wireless charging (unlike my other gadgets). I need to plug them into USB-C to charge. Might not be a big deal for you, but this is a drawback on my radar.-Get a protective case! The existing charging case is well built, and sturdy - but if you're like me, and you put your phone in a protective case, do the same for your earbuds. The case I got was drop proof, and didn't add much to the size (it doesn't take up much space in my pocket). It was $10 for peace of mind. Get an airtag too while you're at it!Overall, would recommend!","Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2024",AFYYCTAQAUEWFDXYF7BHMXS66TJQ,1,196,Color: Black/GoldStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
RWUFM677B047O,B0C2W1KLSS,5.0 out of 5 stars One of the best out there but...,Honest Reviewer Zach,5,"This is hands down one of the best earbuds in the world period. Some cons that I've noticed after using them are.Cons:-The left earbud has low static sound when nothing is playing.-The earbuds pick up a ton of background noise with their microphones. But it's normal.-Note that it's impossible to speak to someone on the phone while, for example you're at a pretty loud gym.-Putting one earbud into the case, pauses whatever you're playing from your phone.-I personally never use transparency mode. However, when putting one earbud into the case, it always switches to transparency mode, and you have to manually change it on the app. The app doesn't allow to set default modes.Pros:-They are build very strong, and earbuds wouldn't come apart and break even if you step on them.-Earbuds are able to connect/link to two devices at the same time and switch between them seamlessly. Few earbuds have this capability if any.-Additionally, earbuds are able to link to your Google account and connect to devices much easier.Overall, very good noise cancellation, sound quality, decent bass, battery life, charging speed, design, feel, and look.Two month update: Sometimes the system notifications get messed up - it notifies you about the percentage of the case and both earbuds every 5 seconds. Sometimes one of the earbuds goes out, without a low battery warning. Putting them into a case for a few seconds fixes this. Also sometimes the noise cancelling gets messed up - it does the exact opposite - adds noise. Again putting both of the earbuds for a couple of seconds into the case fixes this.Six month update:I had to send this product for repair (directly to apple) tree times before all issues were fixed. The first two times, it was free, but the third time I had to pay $84 for them to get fixed.","Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2023",AELKL63BZ7XFD27KO3R6BEVSDWRA,1,72,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
R13FS9E750HR39,B0C2W1KLSS,4.0 out of 5 stars Great for Daily Use,IT Nerd,4,"The media could not be loaded. Quick OverviewI bought these headphones to replace some other earbuds that were beginning to have issues and so far I have really enjoyed these headphones. Since these earbuds are made with Apple in mind, they have easy pairing just like Airpods. They also integrate with Siri to read your texts and notifications, etc. and give you a chance to respond which is a great feature I missed when using another brand. My only complaint at the moment is really just a minor inconvenience - because of the low profile of the earbuds they are harder to grab out of the case since only a few millimeters of the earbuds are sticking out to grab. If you have nails or bigger fingers you might find it annoying to grab out of the case.One of my favorite things about these earbuds is the fact that they have actual physical buttons, NOT have touch buttons. I wear hoodies and it’s so annoying when it brushes a touch button and pauses my music or turns noise cancelling on or off.Crisp and Clear Sound Quality:The sound quality is impressive across various genres of music. The earbuds deliver a well-balanced sound signature with clear vocals, detailed instrument separation, and a mostly satisfying bass response. The highs are crisp, without being harsh, and the mids are well-presented. The bass isn't as punchy as I would like, but with how small these earbuds are that is kind of to be expected. It does provides a good level of depth without overpowering the other frequencies, but if you like a lot of bass these might not be for you. Overall, the sound quality of will please most casual listeners alike and even some music enthusiasts. These earbuds lack customizable EQ settings. This may not be a big deal to some people, but I like to adjust the bass and the highs depending on the genre of music I am listening to.Comfortable and Secure Fit:These earbuds are designed with user comfort in mind. They come with multiple ear tip sizes to ensure a secure fit for different ear shapes. The lightweight and ergonomic design make them comfortable to wear. I've worn them for about 4 hours at a time and will sometimes forget they are there. Personally the Airpods didn't fit in my ear as well and these stay in better for me.Great Noise Cancellation:I prefer active noise cancellation because the fit of passive noise cancellation is usually less comfortable. These earbuds have a solid fit and use active noise cancellation which I prefer - and is pretty impressive. Typically I like to hear my environment when walking my dogs but the noise cancellation is so good I have to turn it off. I could keep noise cancellation on with my old headphones and it really just reduced how loud the noise was. This is also really helpful when I am on a call and my dogs are in the other room. I usually have to keep muting my mic because my dogs are barking, but when testing my girlfriend couldn't hear the dogs while we were on the phone.Incredibly Stable Bluetooth Connection:The connection between these earbuds and my phone is absolutely incredible. Bluetooth connection quality can vary quite a bit but these have one of the most stable and reliable connections that I have ever seen with wireless earbuds. There is virtually no latency. I left my phone in my bedroom and walked about 100 feet and went outside into the backyard and close the door. There wasn't even a stutter with the connection. Amazing.Battery Life:There is always a claim of an impressive battery life with high end earbuds. I haven't had a chance to test yet, but I plan to drain the battery completely on the earbuds and the case and track how long it takes to charge, how long the earbud batteries last, and how long the case battery lasts. I will update this review once I have had a chance to test!Overall the Beats Studio + offer a great audio experience and sound quality, comfortable fit, and amazing wireless connection. While there are a few minor inconveniences, none of them are dealbreakers and these earbuds are a great choice for anyone seeking a good pair of wireless earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2023",AGYDMBJ7K2SRHYL7DHHL37MLHDUQ,1,200,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

R32J1YNX3NHKAE,B0C2W1KLSS,3.0 out of 5 stars Thoroughly disappointed.,atomsk,3,"After having these for some time, I hate to say that I am thoroughly disappointed in them. I bought these to replace my trusty Bose QuietComfort Limited Editions that I’d had for maybe four years. Loved them. They died, and I wasn’t mad because they’d lasted through sweat, rain, dust, etc. Searched and searched for a replacement, bought these as I’d had good experiences with Beats products before. Total. Letdown. The audio quality is okay, but the noise cancellation is temperamental. Battery life is good, charging is good, but that’s about it. The fit is sketchy. They actually fall out of my ears when I sweat. I expect any earbuds to loosen or slip a bit, given my large, odd ears. These, actually fall out. I cannot get the fit to stay good, no matter what size cups I use. And the connectivity is bad. They routinely stop playing sound at random, and can only be restarted from my phone (which is an iPhone) and not from the buttons on the actual earbuds. They disconnect completely sometimes, too. Everything is updated, my device and the earbuds, still lackluster performance. Would not recommend or buy again.","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AHAIK4T6PLM5KOSY4IOEZI5KKJWA,1,10,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

RAORBYYPJJ3F6,B0C2W1KLSS,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great for everyday use, but not for everyone.",Justin,3,"The build quality of the beats are phenomenal. The sound quality on the other hand was slacking. The vocal clarity was great for podcasts and watching movies but when I was listening to music with really any type of bass, the sound seemed to always crackle or breakup. The noise canceling on these earbuds are okay but by no means great. Were these really shine is the call quality. The voice clarity on both ends of a call was fantastic. The easy pair for IOS was very helpful and simple but I wish there was a EQ added. The comfort for me was great for the first hour but after that it really started to hurt my ears even after swapping ear tips. I would say these are great for everyday use and most people would really enjoy them but for me that really didn’t work out. I would recommend these to people if they don’t work in loud environments and listen to softer music or something of that nature. I do say these aren’t worth the price tag that is put on them but if you catch them on sale you won’t be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2024",AEMAUUWREGQR3FBZXIPWQEZHGDNQ,1,12,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
R2M0EDL1MZCNGM,B0C2W1KLSS,4.0 out of 5 stars great gift - but sounds brassy on the other end to me,Beach Berries,4,"These were a gift. I notice that the user enjoys the features within. Quite an upgrade from old/no headphones. As the person they regularly talk to on the phone though, I notice a downgrade to being able to hear them. That might be because they move their head a lot while talking. It sounds brassy and garbled a lot. I have to ask them to repeat things more often. So I would not recommend these to someone buying them for someone you're going to talk on the phone with a lot. : / Otherwise, the user gives them 5 stars. Unfortunately they do not know what they sound like on the phone to others. Maybe it is user error, but it happens nearly every time, and when it is not garbly, it is brassy whereas it was not before with other headphones or speakerphone.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2024",AE7HEXO2ITBYHDTFVMCOQL5AB4KA,1,0,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

To be honest, I forget they’re in my ears, and there are many nights. I fall asleep and forget to remove them. When I wake up this still there and my ears don’t hurt. The only problem I have is getting them out of the case. I guess my hands are too smooth and soft because I can’t pick up the earpiece without using some things to help me. I wish they would make a little groove on the outside that doesn’t go into your ear, so you could grab it that’s the only complaint I have. But I guess that could be me also.

They sound really good and do a good job blocking out noise. The battery life is impressive. But I didn’t love them for the little quirks. I’ve gotten use to my AirPods, which stop music/podcasts automatically when I take them out of my ear. These do not, which is annoying when you have to quickly remove the bud for one reason or another (like work). The real kicker, though, came when I would get phone calls and my phone would connect to the buds IN THEIR CASE in my purse in my car, when I was several feet away. While impressive with the range, it was annoying and inconvenient.Also of note, the case randomly started beeping incessantly while it was just sitting on my desk with both buds in it. Maybe I got a defective pair, but that was the final straw in deciding to send them back.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AGJB2SBKA24M347ZQBY6AVP4MPAQ,1,0,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

R5M5AUQEOJMSM,B0C2W1KLSS,3.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones with frustrating bug with iPhone,Laura G,3,"I like these headphones but there are some serious issues if you use these with an iPhone. Apple has owned Beats for a decade and when connected to Apple products, have a specific menu to control their functionality. I have a fully updated iPhone 11 Pro. Though it's not the newest phone, I should have to have the newest phone to use Apple-supported headphones.Pros:• I can switch between my phone, my iPad, and Macbook pretty easily. I don't have to forget my headphones on one thing in order to connect to another.• The sound quality is pretty good.• They stay in my ears well.• The physical button to pause or skip works well and has a nice feel.• Control of settings like listening mode and button function are in settings on the iOS or Mac OS without needing a third-party app or toggling manually through features on the headphones themselves.• When noise cancelling and transparent modes work, they work pretty well (see cons).Cons:• From day 1, these have had problems staying connected to my iPhone. If I pause or don't have audio playing for a short period of time (usually around 30 seconds though it's happened after about 15 seconds), the headphones disconnect. They will then attempt to reconnect but with no sound. You have to go into Bluetooth settings, disconnect the headphones, wait, and then reconnect. This is when the screen is active and being used, so it can't be blamed on the iOS going into a sleep mode or because the screen is dark. It happens on a daily basis if I pause to talk to someone or if I'm taking a moment to select my next song or YouTube video. Apple Support is no help as their solution is to forget the headphones and re-add them. This fixes the problem for less than a day. I don't have the issue if I'm connected to my laptop or iPad. Yes, my iOS is fully updated and yes, the headphones are fully charged. Again, this has been since I opened them and started using them.• After six months of use, the left earbud has an on and off thumping when I'm in noise cancelling or transparent mode. It's so bad, I've just resigned myself to not using either mode unless I have to.• No wireless charging option. This might be due to Apple proprietary tech, but it's still a con.• Approximately every two or three weeks, I can't change the noise cancelling settings because my phone thinks both headphones are out of the case (you can't use noise cancelling or transparent mode with one earbud). I would have to turn my phone off and restart it to get the modes to work again.Overall, the headache these headphones cause is not worth the convenience of their auto compatibility with Apple products or their sound quality. Apple needs to look into the bugs for iPhone and not brush them off. Won't be buying again and I'm looking for a new alternative to Apple Airpods.","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2024",AGX7ZX53ATOLBXKS3QMWZIUUG4AQ,1,17,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

RR59V1YTAKMN3,B0C2W1KLSS,3.0 out of 5 stars Be aware if you are an AirPods user...,P. Liu,3,"For me, the battery life at around 75% volume is around 7h50m with ANC and Transparency set to Off. The sound quality, and I've owned several HiFi headsets including HiFiMan and Sennheiser's, is nothing ground breaking or it's just typical Beats. So it's okay if you know the Beats sound. For my ears, the default plugs works fine and doesn't appear to fall out.So, several things to note:1) it Does Not automatically switch sources on Apple platforms like AirPods does(you have to manually switch)! It does, however, pair once and connects to all of your devices under the same Apple ID. So it sits somewhere in between the traditional BT headset and an AirPods.2) The case is wider than AirPods Pro case by more than ~1/2"" and taller by ~1/4""... So, kinda big but pocketable.3) For reasons unclear to me, mine unit charges to 98-99%... Not sure what's causing that4) No iOS 'Fit Test' for these buds... So choosing the right plug is your call!5) One reason I'm debugging and still might return the item: On a phone call or FaceTime call, at some point in the call, the other person can not hear my voice until I switch back to either Speaker or iPhone. The little Googling I did suggest that I'm not alone in this, and switching to Speaker then Back to the Buds might recover the microphone.

The noise cancellation? Top-notch, just like the AirPods. But here's the kicker – these fit so much better! They stay put even during my most active moments.

While they are a bit pricey, they are still competitively priced compared to other high-end earbuds on the market.One of the best things about the Beats Studio Buds Plus is their sound quality. For such small earbuds, they produce a surprisingly rich and full sound. The bass is deep and powerful, while the mids and highs are clear and crisp. Whether you're listening to your favorite music or watching a movie, the Beats Studio Buds Plus will provide an immersive audio experience.Another great thing about the Beats Studio Buds Plus is their battery life. They offer up to 9 hours of listening time on a single charge, and the charging case provides an additional 4 charges for a total of 36 hours of listening time. This means you can easily use them all day long without having to worry about running out of battery.The Beats Studio Buds Plus also have a comfortable fit. They come with three different sizes of ear tips, so you can find the perfect fit for your ears. They also have an IPX4 sweat and water resistance rating, so you don't have to worry about them getting damaged if you get caught in the rain or sweat while you're wearing them.Overall, the Beats Studio Buds Plus are a great pair of wireless earbuds. They offer great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit, and a variety of features that make them a great option for anyone looking for a new pair of earbuds.Here are some of the pros and cons of the Beats Studio Buds Plus:**Pros:*** Great sound quality* Long battery life* Comfortable fit* IPX4 sweat and water resistance* Support for both iOS and Android devices* Touch controls* Transparency mode* Active noise cancellation**Cons:*** A bit pricey* No wireless charging* No in-ear detectionIf you're looking for a great pair of wireless earbuds with great sound quality, long battery life, and a comfortable fit, the Beats Studio Buds Plus are a great option.

I appreciate the attempt to make a product more buyer accessible than their powerbeats pro/fit (which at this point are simply overpriced). That said, these buds+ are lackluster at just about everything except listening to audio in quiet-moderately loud environments.Pros: They fit well enough, stay in ear, and are comfortable enough that i often walk into meetings forgetting that I have them in (and then end up yelling a bit do to the anc dulling).Cons: These are absolutely terrible for phone and video calls (facetime, whatsapp, Teams, Zoom, etc). Multiple chats have resulted in me giving up and using my gym headphones or the built in speaker. If these weren't a gift, i'd be upset as travel/in office is my main use case. IYou're better off buying airpods if you want something all around. OR pay more for the powerbeats or Sony buds (could be others that are solid but those are the two i can directly speak to). If you just want decent quality audio for at home or travel, then I suggest you get these on a sale and don't pay more than ~$90 for them.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AEDYCUQ5SNLQNTZFGDXQMFM2UMEQ,1,1,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

Unlike other earbuds on the market, these appear in the power status screen of the device they are paired with letting you know how much charge is left. They were in constant use for about 6 hours and still had 25% of battery life left. The earbud case holds a good good charge and can last several days without charging. The sound quality is good for the price. Scale of 1 to 10. Bass is 7 and Treble is 8. Sound is crisp with no interference or background hiss. Bluetooth is strong, comparable to AirPods if not slightly better. Only drawback is the earbud housing material is slick plastic making it an effort to remove from the case especially in cold weather when the fingers are dry. A grippier material would work better to remove them from the case. I recommend these earbuds if you want to step up prior to investing AirPods.

I asked around at work and it was a tie between these and the second gen airpods pro for popularity. Having an android phone, I knew that if I went with the airpods again, all the headache that would come with using them with an android phone, so I bought the beats studio buds +. Despite having one of the longest names in beats history, these buds have just as long of a battery, claiming nine hours on a charge, which when using them during 12 hour work shifts, I can attest to being true and then some. As someone who has never liked noise cancelling headphones, I actually really enjoy these, especially when on a bus or a plane, they make a huge difference. The sound quality is sharp and clean, and the bass is not overpowering, but still quite noticeable, using the same tricks as the airpods pro. This shouldn't be a surprise because these use the same chip as the airpods family of headphones, so they work great on iPhone, but just as well on android.Pairing is simple and controlled using an app (on Android), which allows all control that would normally be found in iPhone settings","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2024",AHQOAZEU53L72SUQOALTM7EC3YKQ,1,2,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

I have found many Noise Cancelling headphones block the noise out for me, but not for the callers on the other end.These work amazing when I am on my cell phone. I tested it out where I was driving with my windows down, then I turned my radio up. I record myself leaving a message so that I can hear what the other person hears. These did great blocking a lot of the sound out for the caller on the other end when on my cell phone.When on Zoom or Google Meet calls on the computer, these did a lot better than any others I had. It didn't do as well as when I was on my cell phone, but still blocked out some of the noise around me for the other callers.The downside to these is the fit. I have small ears and have trouble finding earbuds that will stay in my ear. Unfortunately, I have to adjust these often and I don't find them as comfortable, but, again, I have small ears.

While the earphones themselves have no equalizer settings, I mostly use Spotify and have been able to tune the buds to my desired taste through Spotify.The active noise canceling is easy to turn on/off and I was really surprised how well they work. My washing/dryer unit can be fairly noisy in my open floor plan apartment. I could not hear it running at all when I put the noise canceling on.I love the aesthetic of the buds and they fit perfectly in my ears out of the box. I do miss the feature of my AirPods where the buds would start/stop playing if it was inserted/removed from my ears. I can see myself accidentally putting the buds down and forgetting they are still going. I deducted a star because while the case and buds are stylish and sleek, I find they are a bit too smooth. the buds are a little difficult to firmly grasp and I’m afraid they’ll slip out of my fingers while handling them.

This has nothing to do with the noise level because it happens in pretty quiet places as well.For listening to music and audio books it is excellent. My favorite thing is that each earbud can be used independently while the other one is charging. This means that I can listen to podcasts and audio books non-stop. Battery life is very good as well. ANC is excellent as well.The only complaint I have is with the microphone being flaky. Everything else is amazing. Unfortunately I bought it specifically for the microphone.","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2024",AGCUQGEY2AZ5NQM5WYWW5RSVHRFQ,1,0,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

AirPod pros don’t fit in my ears well and I ended up choosing the fit pros over these. These ones looked ridiculous in my ear, like two rectangles or a ruler sticking so far out of my ears when looking at me from the front. I also thought the sound was a lot more sharp, like s, sh, and f sounds were super highlighted and tinny for my liking. That, along with the stupid way they looked in my small ears made me choose the fit pros. Which are still big but for some reason they don’t stick out as obviously as the studio buds+. Also, the sound quality on the fit pros in my opinion was way better. However, the ivory on the studio buds+ is freaking gorgeous vs the offensive brightness of the fit pro white lol.","Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2023",AGXXPYYYRGIHLFLWUEPR6FWECHLA,1,9,Color: IvoryStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

My left AirPod was completely useless. After being told that they were ultimately not impacted by their recall, I could pay nearly $100 for one single AirPod replacement. Safe to say I spent the afternoon looking for alternatives. The Beats Studio Buds are comparable, and dare I say better!They offer everything that I need as far as noise cancellation and sound quality - great on both accounts. My only complaint is that at the time of my purchase, the grey buds were the only ones on sale. Would have gone for a different color if there wasn't such a price difference, but I slapped on case on them and they're just as good.","Reviewed in the United States April 29, 2024",AHTEHJCA4KHH7QEG5VI6JFL6SFVA,1,1,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

Speaking of the case the new clear option for both it and the buds is great and in my opinion the way to go. Battery life is outstanding for the size of the buds and the case. Ear tips are mid, but get the job done. I would always get a good pair of foam tips for ear buds anyways though. I would and have recommended these to friends looking for a new pair of buds.

These are very close to the new Apple Air Pod Pro gen 2 for music sound quality and in ear comfort, but the new transparency mode is mediocre and feels a little congested.

Tested them out.If you bought these because of bass and you love bass, the bass selections that are already on the app don’t work at all and only add just about 5 percent extra bass if you chose one.You’d have to play with the EQ in order to get the bass to work. Since I love speakers a lot and find them fun to use and enjoy the bass part. I’ve messed with the EQ on my phone and got the bass where it’s strong and sounds good but also to where you can still hear it.I also found out that clear to the right on EQ, if you wanted to hear more of the voice, then move the label 4K up higher. It will decrease the bass by a small percentage but still give you that advantage to listen to the bass and still hear the voice louder.Lowering the 4K will add more bass and lower the voice.I’ve provided screenshots of what my configurations are on the EQ and what my general settings are for these earbuds from JBL.My final review is the color is cool, the case is well durable, the earbuds themself are comfortable in your ears, they work well and have a high volume sound. They last a good amount of hours as well which is a big + for me.I did notice someone had posted a review regarding the EQ, I’ve used their EQ style and it flattens the bass and does not give you the bass you want. Otherwise, hopefully this EQ I set up works for others!","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AGKRP6VGHJ2JTZLUNZ7VP7UHBFHA,1,71,Color: Black
R10T5CDIG6Q5UX,B0BQPGJ9LQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Top quality audio after a few adjustments,P. Dobrinen,5,"This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal. However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use. I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent. Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products. In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about. However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears. I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box. If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them. Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds. After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum. I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app. You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB. I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work. I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams. I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions. However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself. I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit). As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen). What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves. During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume). Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode. The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene. However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds. The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see. I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source. There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.","Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2023",AHY4E66OMDCFPZWPUF5YLKKGZBHA,1,1206,Color: White
R2154XSZDSZH0Z,B0BQPGJ9LQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Decent ear buds, but fit isn't exact and battery life is questionable",warren smith,4,"I had to replace a set of headphones that stopped working. So this time I thought I would try a set of earbuds instead. I know JBL usually have good products, price was decent, so I thought I would try these.First I will say the sound and volume are pretty good. If you are using these on your phone, the JBL app also makes a big difference with the equalizer and the other ""hear through"" type features if you don't want to block out all noise. Really wish they had a similar app for PC, as I use them on my laptop more than my phone. And is really when I need to hear people talking etc.With that said, the fit isn't great, I tried all the different sizes of the rubber covers, but none seem to fit right in my left ear for some reason. I've had it fall out once already when just bending over to pick something up off the floor.They are also difficult to get out of the case, the lid should open further or just have a way to grab a hold of them easier.The battery life is ok, but doesn't seem to be anywhere near the 32 hours listed, including the recharge feature of the case. I've gotten about half that, before they kept telling me they were ""low battery"". And I had to charge them and the case both back up.all in all, these may work good for some people. I am thinking about returning them and trying something else though.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AFN6273O6VY3TZWBMRRXBI5BLU6Q,1,46,Color: Black

I listened to the song ‘Comfort Eagle’ by Cake and it was flat. In order to feel any bass I had to pump up the volume so much my ears hurt—and I’ve heard this song with off-brand buds before and they produced the punch this song delivers very well.And, yes, I attempted a proper fit in my ears and could not find it with any of the provided ear tips.I found it a bit of a challenge to remove the buds from the case, something I’ve not experienced with other buds I’ve owned.Lastly, I knew at purchase that these had to be charged with a USB-C cable, which is not a deal breaker by any means, but with all of the cordless charging available, it was a shame these did not have that feature. Even the off-brand buds my wife got had it AND they had great sound.I really wanted these to work out.

R2GR6OW2RNMQDK,B0BQPGJ9LQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Blow my $250 Sony XM's away at 1/10th the price.,Bootney Lee Farnsworth,5,"It's incredibly hard to find decent earbuds these days. Over the past 5 years I've probably owned 10-15 sets, ranging from $12 sets to $300 sets and THEY ALL HAVE PROBLEMS. From dropped connections to failing batteries or just plain crappy sound. So, this review is just on sound quality alone as I haven't put them through the gym ringer yet. Right out of the box these are the best sounding buds I've owned. The app is outstanding as well. I use a professional equalizer, but found that the app's equalizer is good enough on its own, that you really don't need anything else (though I use both for added volume and treble tweaks). These are LOUD, which is necessary at my gym to drown out the repugnant music selection played full blast through the Temu speakers on the wall and 18"" ridiculous subwoofers. I turn the buds all the way up and cut my source to about 65% and its plenty loud. The bass is more than adequate (had to turn it way down). But most importantly, the treble is good. This is unusual for earbuds. The treble is always the weak point in earbuds for whatever reason. Here, it's crisp and clear (if you know what you're doing with the eq). That's the thing. Knowing how to dial that equalizer in is the difference between your B&W 805d's at home and the crappy soundbar at your buddy's apartment. At $30, this is a no brainer. Even if they explode in my ears whilst I'm takin' the 120's for a ride, the last song I heard will be permanently etched in my mind for eternity.

The earbuds sit nicely in the charging case and for people with big hands I can see how they can be a bit difficult to take out but that doesn’t bother me at all.I mainly just want to say that at first the sound quality was very thin with absolutely no BASS response and I thought, oh well, this is what I get for the great price point of these ear buds. It wasn’t until I changed out the ear pieces that the BASS came alive! The buds come with the medium sized ear pieces. I switched those out for the large size and this created the seal inside my ear canal that it needs for the BASS.For all those reviews that say it lacks Bass, it does not, you just have to try another size ear piece.

Out of the box I was impressed with the way everything was packed. Everything was wrapped and perfectly placed so that no damage would occur during shipping. The ear buds fit great in my ear and haven't fallen out, even when moving around in 100 degree temperatures. That's a huge plus for me! The overall sound is incredible considering the price. The sound is great even when switching from one genre to another. I'm a metal head, so having the ability to hear every instrument precise and clear is what I've been looking for. The vocals are crisp and clear. Even when the band has a high pitched vocalist and a deep, throaty vocalist.My only disappointment is the JBL App. I was hoping that the app would give you better options, but it doesn't, it has 4 choices for the equalizer, jazz, vocals, bass and extra bass. And then you can try to make an equalizer that fits your listening wishes. If your like me and don't have the required understanding of sound at different levels, then you get 4 basic options! Plus the app has very little else to make it worth downloading.If I remember, I will update my review in the coming weeks.

You can turn this feature off with the app. The ""find my buds"" feature in the app for this is great in theory, but pretty useless in real life practice. (I lost one of them a week after owning them.) unless they are currently on and bluetooth connected to the phone with the app you can't make it ping the bud and make a sound to find it. so despite knowing where I lost the bud and knowing i was in range I couldn't find it.

R3DAOPJS3S05AZ,B0BQPGJ9LQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Great phone call quality and great sound but....,David F,4,"Unfortunately the battery life is terrible. I work as a service advisor at a large dealership. I use the right ear peice only most of the time so I can clearly hear customers and technicians, but still hear and receive messages and calls. I love how clearly I can hear people on phone calls and how well they can hear me. Unless I'm in the back shop with the loud noises from the mechanics (of course). I only get about a half of a work day before I hear the friendly female voice say ""battery low"", and I'm forced to put the right one back in the charging case and switch to the left, which is not preferable as I use my left ear to answer the work phone.My only other negative is that you can't use the find my feature if they're in the case. The other evening as I was emptying my pockets to go to bed I noticed they were missing. It turns out they fell out of my pocket while home TV and it it took me a while to find them. It would've been nice to be able to find them quicker.On the positive side though.I love the ambient aware feature so I really can have conversations without taking them out.They are comfortable and stay in my ears even on my 7 mile bike ride home after work.The sound quality for videos and music are great, no complaints there.When these die or I lose them I'll definitely stay with JBL. Either these again or I'll see if there's one with a little better battery life.Overall you can't beat the price for what you get.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AGVJCPIQL44TOKGPKO7G7VE424FA,1,5,Color: Black

Comfortable fit, the battery life is decent, I get about 10-12 hours with consistent usage. You do need to download the JBL app for optimal use, and unlocking functions. Each ear bud has a different function without the app. For, instance tapping one of them up or down will pause music, calls, etc. Tapping the other, will turn volume up or down. Biggest flaw I'd say is the charging cord. It's only about 6 inches long.

R3FBAAVMWI9SUD,B0BQPGJ9LQ,3.0 out of 5 stars Really disappointed,Brian,3,"JBL is a trusted name in electronics, so I was confident when I purchased these. However, let the disappointment begin...For starters, the shell that holds the buds is super slippery. I wish everyone would stop that, they are so hard to handle while trying to get the buds out.Now let's talk about the buds. They too are super slippery. It makes just getting the buds out of the case frustrating as all get out unless you have tiny fingers, I s'pose. On top of that, the way they position the buds inside the case for charging is mirrored of how Apple does it, and it's the wrong way. When you take the buds out, they are backwards to how you would put them in your ear. Now I need to spin them around just to put them in my ear, and again, they are slippery! I have big hands, so what might be a simple task for many is not simple for me. I drop them as a result and it just takes more time to answer a call.What's even more frustrating than that is that they do not automatically connect for inbound calls. I always have to answer, then connect them manually. For outgoing calls, it has not been an issue at all.Lastly, the call quality is subpar. My Apple Air Pods had great call quality (yes, I know how much they cost), but we're decades deep into these products, hard to understand why these would not provide a better connection.Disappointed...","Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2024",AFEUVUECUEMMZAYFDJFSK2EPHPPA,1,17,Color: Black

There is a slight audio delay between video and audio, and the audio quality is just not that great, but I am assuming that’s apple’s doing for using a non apple product with their phone. I used to use these with a samsung product and they were awesome, liked em a lot. I mostly plan to use these to just listen to stuff, not really watch and listen, so imma keep em because screw apple. If google can make youtube worse on non chrome browsers, im sure apple can affect a device by making the quality a bit worse and purposefully putting in a delay.One month use update: my only real complaint is that they are kind of hard to put away quickly. It takes concentration because you have to rotate them before you put them away, and I have fumbled/dropped them fairly regularly when I am trying to put it away in a hurry or without looking at it. Its hard if you’re trying to put them away with anything else in your hands like a pen, book, bag/purse, sunglasses etc.The charging case could be improved if they made it so that you didn't have rotate them after you took them out of your ears in order to put them away, and if they made the stems completely rounded so that they rotated smoothly.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2024",AH3DCSUNI7EEVZQZDKXXSYSKTABQ,1,14,Color: White

I was looking into getting the AirPods Pro again, but decided I just didn’t want to spend that much money. After some research I ended up choosing JBL Vibe Beam and felt fairly comfortable with my decision because I am a fan of JBL. I do not regret it at all. They are better than AirPods by far - piece of advice get the “JBL Headphones” app. The earbuds automatically come on the Jazz setting so I could see how someone wouldn’t be satisfied. You can change the equalizer (I used one of the top picture reviews and copied how they had theirs, but they also have other presets). I listen to a lot of Rap, Metal Alternative, etc. so bass is a huge thing for me and using the equalizer was a game changer. The sound is so clear and the bass is amazing. This is probably the most satisfied I’ve ever been with an earbud purchase. It’s also super easy to connect them. The name showed up right away so the total process maybe took 10-15 seconds to pair them for the first time, which is pretty rare.

When it's off, the noise cancelling ability is pretty good* from the app, you can turn on/off the function that let's you stay aware of sounds around you (like people talking to you, or cars, etc). If it is turned on, and someone talks to you, it automatically lowers the volume so you can gear them, while the misic is still playing. This is really helpful when I'm wearing them at work, and I have to be aware of when my coworkers and bosses are talking to me* you can turn volume control on & off using the app, to minimize hearing damage* comfortable to wear & come with different cushion sizes so they can fit your ear better* I like the quality of the case, & how the automatically turn off when you place them inside* battery life is fantastic & the light on the cade keeps you informed of when you need to recharge (the light color changes to let you know). It's a good idea to prime the battery, letting them due completely once or twice before charging* quick & easy to charge* there is a ""find my earbud"" feature on the app, so that's handy if you loose one, because that can easily happenCons* the earbuds are very sensitive to use the touch control, so I frequently turn them off by accident adjusting the earbud or* I have issues with them falling out unless they are very firmly inserted* the earbuds are not marked left & right* maybe it's because I'm a bit older, but the touch controls get confusing, for how many taps and/ or holding the ""button"" for a couple of seconds to control for different functions (all I remember is one tap is on/off). Hoping that will become easier as I use them longer.Overall, and really happy with them & recommend buying them. I highly recommend downloading the app to access all the features (make sure it is the JBL for headphones app).","Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2024",AFMCQG5VGJL7JUFBQQVMURQ7AN5Q,1,89,Color: Black
R8JI850UJDRDR,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth the money!,Moma Z,5,"I researched on this earbuds for a year when it came out but it was so expensive. Then this year I saw that it's on installment and discounted. It even got more affordable this month, wish I waited longer. I love this because I have the Z Fold 5, been a phablet x stylus user since Note 2! There are so many reasons to invest in this earbuds, most especially if you're a Samsung user.First, it just integrates with my phone intuitively and I can use it with my MacBook 2017 and Garmin Fenix 6s! The Wearable widget helps reconnect the earbuds back to the phone faster than fumbling with the app. I can continue listening to a song or podcast on Spotify from my phone to my laptop and back to my phone, and the sound quality and volume doesn't change.Second, the connectivity is sustained better than other wireless earbuds, whether watching a video, listening, or gaming! There's a gaming option that minimizes the lag between the sound and game action. I can leave my phone farther and still listen to music, or more important, get calls while doing tasks more than 20 feet or more away - even between 2 rooms apart. I had cheaper buds that once I close our steel-cored front door, the connection with my phone will be disrupted even if my phone is just right next to the door.Third, I love the responsiveness to equalizer adjustments! I'm not a sound engineer or audiophile but I used their reviews to narrow down my options based on the products that produce the best sound qualities on the range of frequencies I can already hear with my naked ears. We appreciate sounds differently so it depends on individual hearing but we'd agree that these pricey things respond fast! My hearing was tested, I'm also trained in classical music, and have a healthcare background, so my ears seek refined details from music or physiological sounds. I don't like too much enhanced bass and uncomfortable loudness, as those can lead to deafness. These buds can be loud and bass-proud too! Fresh from the box, these buds were on Normal settings on the Wearable equalizer. To me, I heard the lower frequencies more than the higher ones but I can still distinctly appreciate the higher registers. So I tweaked the equalizer and it responds immediately!!! That equalizer doesn't allow customization but Spotify allows it. I noticed that the Dynamic option looks like the Harman Curve, whether you're a fan of it or not, it's preset already. Although with these earbuds, I can tell if music has been rendered with Dolby, HiFi or some technology... some music do sound unnatural. I had to check the music piece I'm studying if I heard the musical dynamics right, as I might be attempting to produce that sound quality in real life.Now, the stuff I don't like... first, these were so uncomfortable at the start. I can't bear these in my ears for 30 minutes when I first got it. I had to stretch my earlobes and wear these for staggered periods of time per day. I mixed and matched between small and mid-sized tips until the buds fit test say they're ok and it does feel comfortable. It took me a week to adjust my ears and now I can wear them 4 to 6 hours straight. I almost returned these but I thought I'm used to having wired earphones and it's the sacrifice to wireless earbuds that do work. Just like others advice, do the fit test frequently until the fit feels right.Second, the charging case isn't waterproof and shockproof, so I bought the Samsung armor for it. Both the buds and case get dusty pretty quickly. I clean the tips and case with alcohol and tissue.Third, I don't like that it's protruding out of my earlobes but it is what it is. As of this writing, it's one of the smaller and lighter earbuds. I've tried working out and doing sports with these, they pop out when I clench my jaw, move my head in many directions or jump. I have to strap these so if it does pop out, it'll hang from my shoulders and not get stepped on.Oh well, enjoy yours!","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2024",AEEYPCERJ7I4TEGT7BFFPJPOWG7A,1,36,Color: WhiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only
R9PNQ2PK9B6MU,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Positively Amazing!,J,5,"I bought these for my wife. We have bought at least four different sets of earbuds, including off brand and Bose. These Samsung Galaxy Pro 2 Earbuds stand out from the others. I am not sure if it is because of them matching my Samsung Galaxy S20+ or if it is just because they were designed very well and with significant thought. But they are truly amazing.First, setup took less than thirty seconds. Nice simple easy, just the way it should be.The sound quality is equal to Bose. Within the application (Galaxy Wearable), you have an equalizer that offers six different settings. As of this moment I have not found any way to customize the equalizer. These earbuds offer 360 surround sound and head tracking, which allows the sound to focus on the direction of the device that it is coming from. Turning your head to one side makes the earbuds focus the sound a little more to the earbud. I guess that would work great if watching videos or something. For music, I really see no significance.The fit is perfect. They come with three different sizes. My wife needs the smallest and they fit perfectly for her ears. The middle size fits my ears. They are easily changed in a matter of a few seconds. Once on, you do not need to worry about the sleeves coming off easily as with many other brands.The noise cancellation is positively amazing! I have a two-year-old that has the ability to shatter glass with their voice. My ears ring when they scream, and they scream A LOT. That feature alone sold me. As soon as I tried her buds, I went back to Amazon and ordered a pair for me! I can still hear my child, but it no longer murders my ear drums, which is perfect. This nice feature actually enables me to keep my volume down to a safer level. I can't wait to test these buds against my riding mower.Then let's talk about background sound during a conversation on the phone. Every other earbud I and my wife have ever tried has been able to pick up significant background noise. These earbuds seriously focus on the voice of the wearer and not just every sound around them. You can hear their voice clearly and the background noise seems to be ""further away"" making conversation much easier for the other side of the call.These earbuds offer head tilt reminders. I use my computer a lot and when I am working, I do have the tendency to tilt my head forward. These earbuds detect when you keep your head tilted too long and remind you.Notifications are identified by a voice with these earbuds. This is also customizable based according to the application and you can set it to read the notifications in more detail. I know if it is a text message, e-mail or application notification, which is great. Now I don't have to look at my phone every single time to determine if the notification warrants my attention.Operation of the earbuds is pretty simple. While the volume control will certainly take me a little to adapt to, the rest is understandable. First, you can customize the earbuds response to taps and holds (holding finger to a certain earbud) so that you get the features that are most important to you. That alone is nice since no earbud I have experienced has ever allowed this. One downside is the volume control. Where all the other earbuds in the past either had buttons to raise or lower volume or the ability to slide the finger up or down on one earbud, these require both earbuds. The left lowers the volume while the right raises the volume. Answering phone calls (default) is simply double tapping the right earbud. Playing music, tapping the right or left earbud will pause the music and one tap again will resume the music. Double tapping will skip forward one track and triple tap backs it up one track. Of course, as mentioned earlier, you can change this in the application to suit your needs.Battery life is pretty impressive. They boast 29 hours of battery life. So far that seems to be true. My wife uses her earbuds all day and does not need to drop them back into the charger during her daily routine. This certainly stands out against the Bose earbuds I have used that have only about a 3-hour battery life. On top of the extended battery life compared to others, if you are using only one earbud and leaving one in the case, you can change out earbuds mid-call and not lose your call. That is a feature I have never had the privilege of enjoying with other earbud brands.The charging case is simple to use. Just drop the earbuds in. The charging port is a USB-C and they provide a cord in the package. Compatibility to other brand phones seems to be a possible problem, but honestly, I expected that. My wife has an I-phone for work and is not able to connect to it with these earbuds as of yet. The internet does claim they will connect and to my knowledge, they should since Bluetooth is pretty much Bluetooth, and the technology should be the same across all devices.Another nice feature I enjoy is earbud location detection. They will show on a map using GPS, where your earbuds are, which is nice. Also, you can make them ring out to locate them if you are at their location, but just don't see them. These location features do require having the Smart Things application, which is also available in the google play store.Overall, these earbuds are amazing, and they are competitively priced. I highly recommend these for just about anybody.","Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2023",AGODX7KBXEAUHO2KB5T5PFLGM3IQ,1,155,Color: Bora PurpleStyle: Buds2 Pro Only
RJ7FBR7Y2SYWI,B0B2SH4CN6,"5.0 out of 5 stars Best Samsungs Yet, but not Perfect",Mr. Stateham,5,"I upgraded to these after owning the Galaxy Buds Live, which is a very different design. I'm not an audiophile, but I am fairly experienced with mid-tier sound equipment, speakers, and headphones. I built my own 11.1 surround sound movie room using a higher end Yamaha receiver and have used Klipsch, Polk Audio, Paradigm, BIC America, Sony, Yamaha, Pioneer, Bose (don't judge me, they work well in some applications), JL Audio, JBL, Mirage, and other brands of speakers through the years in home and car audio setups. For headphones, I've mainly used wired as early wireless models sounded hollow and tinny in comparison. I've used lower end AKG and Sony buds, as well as mid-tier Sennheisers. I've also used higher end Sony over-ear headphones as well as the highly rated (but lesser known) Status Audio CB-1 studio monitor headphones.I waited a while to buy into the wireless headphone market and finally took the plunge with the Buds Live as they offered something my wired headphones didn't—ambient sound. Usually this is an unwanted distraction and noise isolation is preferred, but sometimes I want to be aware of what's going on around me and be able to engage in a conversation even if I have my buds in. Apple did this well with their pass-through technology, but I'm not about to switch over to an entirely new product line and closed ecosystem just for headphones, so I waited. The Buds Live managed this trick with a low-tech solution by not sealing in the ear canal, so I gave them a try. Sound quality was decent—on par with my lower end AKG wired buds, but not as good as my mid-tier (~$100) Sennheiser buds. They also were finnicky with their connection and cut out a lot if my phone was in my pocket, especially if I bent over or squatted.BUDS 2 PRO:I upgraded to these as they also had a pass-through feature which seemed to work fairly well and did so automatically when you started talking. I figured this would be just as good and offer better sound and isolation when desired. Overall I think this feature works pretty good and is a nice compromise for me. In terms of sound quality, the Buds 2 Pro are definitely a step up from the Buds Live and probably on par with my wired mid-tier Sennheisers. I can't complain about the sound quality at all.As with the Buds Live though, the Buds 2 Pro require a bit of fidgeting to get them seated in the ear properly. Traditional ear buds, and even Apple's Airpods require little thought or adjustment beyond getting the right sized rubber or foam tips for a good seal. Samsung seems to go for more experimental designs which require learning and getting used to. After a few days use, they still aren't ""natural"" to put in or locked into muscle memory—I have to fuss with them a bit to get a good seal. Once in though, I haven't had any problems.Overall, I recommend these buds. They still aren't perfect as the fit isn't intuitive, battery life a little meager, and the noise cancellation is about 85-90%, not 100, but overall, solid headphones. Could you get way better sounding wired headphones for tons less money? Yes, for about $50 you can pick up a pair of Status CB-1's and hear every fine detail in high fidelity. But in the wireless in-ear category, prioritizing convenience and mobility over everything else, these perform admirably. I've heard Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 3 buds *might* edge these out in terms of sound quality, but they look a lot more bulky (stick out more from the ear and therefore may be less stable) and don't have the automatic ambient sound pass-through feature. They also are a touch more money. On the upside though, they appear to be a more traditional bud design, so might be more straightforward to put in, but Airpods are probably still the easiest to put in and take out.But I plan on using the Buds 2 Pro for years before feeling the need to upgrade again. I'm satisfied with the purchase, though still wincing at the cost-to-performance ratio compared to wired options. Can't knock a product for performing in the top tier of its specific market though, so I'll give it 5 stars as a true wireless earbud, but would give it 4 in sound quality against cheaper wired in-ear and over-ear options.","Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2022",AHWTNTH42P3AHBPICP3ZSJLPVBGA,1,261,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

I have to wear my Sony ear buds when running if I want distance, speed...updates. Not sure if this is due to google pixel phone or the earbuds software, but it's annoying.

R2R1WB0JDING7Z,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars I think I'm in Love,AB,5,"I've had these Buds 2 Pro for a few days now and I'm in love with them. I paired them to a Samsung S22 Ultra, so they work together like peas and carrots.HEAD TRACKING: I like the head tracking feature. If you turn your head away from your media the sound increases in the bud that is closest to your device. Keeps the sound focused in the direction of the device. It's rather neat.FIT: I had to change the earpieces out to the smallest right away, but it's important that you get a good fit.They don't bulge from my ears much. Just a bit. There is ""Check fit"" area in the Samsung App.ANC: The noise cancelling is pretty amazing. Actually makes you appreciate the silence when you turn it on. Very close to perfect silence.AMBIENT SOUND: When you switch to ambient sound, the best way to describe it is like a hearing aid. Everything seems a bit loud at first, but you can hear what's going on around you once you get used to it. You don't realize how much white noise is in your environment until you switch off ANC.VOICE DETECTION: I'm not sure if I like the voice detection so much. When you start singing along with the music, your sound decreases until you remember to turn it off. It works well if you're in an office environment and want to lower the audio if you are talking but the shortest return time is 5 seconds if voice is detected. I wish there were a shorter time. Turning on the ambient sound can also be enough. The jury is still out on that feature.TOUCH CONTROLS: The touch controls are responsive, but I wish I could change the taps to customize it more. I might want to switch between noise cancelling and ambient sound or change the volume, but I can only do one or the other with the current setup. It wasn't a deal breaker for me.COMFORT: They're comfortable enough for me to have in my ears for an extended period of time with the correct sized earpiece. They're easy to insert, but button presses are inevitable when inserting them. They sync right up to my Samsung phone and watch.FASHION: My ears are quite small, so the tiny ends were my choice. They don't bulge out of my ear too much. Just a little, really. Sometimes I can hear my hair brush the buds and a wet head has tripped a button press, but it hasn't been a deal breaking issue. Just something to be aware of.I haven't tried using these in bed, which will probably happen at some point as I like to catch up on shows when I can't sleep, so I can't speak for comfort if you lay on one ear while using them.OVERALL : Fit is good. Sound is nice. They're very responsive and easy to use. I'd recommend them to any Samsung user for compatibility and interoperability. I think I'd get these even if I used something other than Samsung, though. They're well made and the texture is rubber-like so they're easy to handle. Case can charge wirelessly, which is a convenient plus.","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2023",AEDZG63RE35BTYYIVOFECPY4TF5Q,1,149,Color: Bora PurpleStyle: Buds2 Pro Only
R2MOU34QHN1AIU,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Why did I wait so long to buy these,Thor20,5,"All of my mobile devices are Samsung products. I have the Samsung Note 20 Ultra phone, the Tab 8 Ultra tablet and now I have the latest earbuds Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. Not sure why I waited so long to purchase Samsung earbuds. I would usually purchase either Sony or Jabber and in one case the Amazon Echo Buds (Priced right and used for travel - it lost I didn't pay a lot of $$$ for them). Back to the review. I find the Galaxy Buds to be on par regarding sound, battery life, features, and fit with my Jabber's 75T and close to the 85t.Sound:The earbuds have a rich sound that can be enhanced using the built-in EQ settings. Listen to a lot of Audible Audiobooks and often set the eq to voice. I can clearly hear the voice even when the narrator has a booming bass-filled voice. For music, they do not disappoint either. The sound is rich and clear and has a nice amount of base that does not drown out the vocals.Battery:Battery life is great for my needs. I use these on walks and when my wife drags me along on a shopping trip. With ANC enabled that lasts for about 5 ish hours.Features:-I love how these integrate into the Samsung echo systems. The same Samsung Galaxy wearable app I use for my Samsung Watch 6, is used to manage the earbuds.-Voice Detect is a very cool feature that allows me to automatically turn on ambient sound and lower the volume for a quick conversation. Normal playback resumes after 5, 10, or 15 settings. That way when someone approaches me to have a conversation, I do not have to tap the earbuds or fumble around with my phone to stop playback. This feature also seems to know if I am actually talking to someone versus singing along with the music, super cool tech!-Touch controls are good but limited. For instance, where you can customize what a tap does it does not allow customization for the individual buds. If I set the custom setting of ""Touch and Hold"" to switch noise controls, noise control is then enabled on both the left and right bud. I wish that I could make the left bud handle the noise control and the right handle volume down or something along those lines.-360 Audio:Helps to enhance the overall sound, probably through the EQ settings. The sounds seem to be more dynamic and make me want to dance. There is also a head-tracking function that is used for video/movies. Head tracking adjusts the sound direction when you turn your head, making it seem like the sound is coming from the direction you are looking.Fit:Fit can be subjective as it really depends on your biology. These earbuds have been the best fitting earbuds for me ever. My more expensive Sony WF-1000XM4 had great sound and features but fell short in the fitment department for me, same goes for the Jabra 75T/85T.Summary:My entire immediate family uses the Samsung Echo system. I have purchased these earbuds for everyone but myself. I guess I was being an earbud snob, thinking these were inferior to the likes of Sony and Jabra. These are great earbuds and I recommend you give them a try. I wish I had tried them much sooner. I was going to buy the newer Sony buds WF1000 XM5, but the Samsung bud2 pros were a steal compared to the Sony's so I decided to give them a try. I am so happy I did as these are now my go-to earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2023",AE6F63OVVYNPLQIU2HVJYDXHIVOA,1,35,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

R2V1YJUQOEQU7R,B0B2SH4CN6,1.0 out of 5 stars Total garbage!,The Critic,1,"These are quite possibly the most expensive, worst earbuds I've ever purchased in my life.I own the original Galaxy buds, which are fantastic. They stay in my ears, they seal well and have great sound because of the fit and drivers. The originals pair easily with my Motorola phone and the app works fine. Regular updates kept them working and up-to-date. I even accidentally left the case with the earbuds inside of them outside on a summer night when it rained, the next day I thought I was sunk. I took them in, dried them off and they've been working fine 2 years later... The original Galaxy buds are that good.For me the originals were missing one or two things that I thought would make it worth the upgrade. Active noise cancellation was huge for me and the originals do not have this. I like to use my earbuds outside in the summer doing yard work like cutting the lawn weed whipping and things like that... I sweat profusely and need something that's resistant to water and sweat. They also have to stay in my ears as I'm actively moving around on a lawn, where if one were to fall out good luck to me finding it... I was also interested in the sound pass thru feature that lets you hear ambient sound, if you wish while wearing the buds, the originals have this but it is not in stereo, so it does not help you if you were walking on the street or riding a bike. You would hear a car coming but could not distinguish the direction. These 2 Pros have stereo pass thru.Anyway, on Amazon Prime, garage sale day I decided to go ahead and pick these up for almost $200 (I know what was I thinking?)... I was excited for the upgrades. The headphones came and I immediately noticed something that I had not researched before, these headphones are not actually made by Samsung engineering, they are made by AKG. AKG happenes to make headphones for studio applications and they usually have a very flat, tinny or shrill response that I've never liked. This was a bad sign...I paired the earbuds to the phone using the same app as the originals and all went well. After an update I was ready to give them a shot. The earbuds would not stay in my ears. Try as I might they slipped and slid and they kept falling out of my ears. This is frustrating because it's purely down to the design of the shallow ear canal, speaker. I have no idea why they would have gone with a different shape as the earbuds now only barely sit in the ear canal. The speakers do not seal no matter which ear tips I tried as the earbuds came with three different silicone sizes. The design of these headphones is baffling. A quick Google search will point out that this is a very common problem that I was not aware of before I purchased them, and people will recommending purchasing aftermarket tips to solve this problem. After spending this much on a pair of earbuds, no way am I going to start looking for fixed to their major design flaws, spending more money and time in the process. The Samsung Wear app even has a setting that helps you test, to see you when you have a good seal on the earbuds which I could not attain unless I violently jammed them in my ears, to which they only stayed sealed for maybe 30 seconds before they started coming out and just plopped out of my ears every single time. Wrestling the earbuds into your ears is an exercise and frustration as every time you touch the stupid things you activate some setting or pause a song or switch to the next song or mute them or try to make a call... It's infuriating!After 20 minutes of a balancing act and attempting to get the earphones to stay in my ears, with a good seal, I finally was able to get them to stay for just a few seconds while I not moving at all. This was not going to work outside, but I wanted to test some of the other features. This led me to testing the active noise canceling which although the app told me I had a good seal did absolutely nothing but to block out only the slightest breeze of the AC in the house. It failed to even block out the fault hum of the washing machine, running in my laundry room. What?! When using something like a lawn mower or a leaf blower these will do 100% absolutely nothing. I am positive the attempt to block out the sound of airplane engines would also be futile with this extremely wimpy ""noise canceling""... This is a major disappointment and as far as I'm concerned false advertising.I decided to give the sound a shot just to hear how they reproduce music that I've listened to for years with no issues on my original Galaxy buds which I think sound great. Just as I feared, typical AKG, no matter which setting I chose the highs are so hyped they tickled my eardrums in the most unpleasant of ways, irritating me to the point where I had to literally turn the music down to the lowest volume to be able to bear the shrill, high-pitched highs. I tried every EQ setting they offer and not one of them took away this ridiculous high-pass. Complete and utter, $200 fail!I honestly can't express how disappointed I am in these things and would urge anyone to simply stay away. These are a huge disappointment and have soured me from Samsung audio products. How could they get it so right the first time around and totally doo-doo the bed, with these?!TLDRTerrible sound quality, horrible fit, ridiculously ineffective active noise canceling, huge unwarranted price tag.Total garbage.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2023",AGHMOR4A4MZUIVGIMRCFLGWUSTXQ,1,103,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only
R1MPDBUZ6S8TAH,B0B2SH4CN6,4.0 out of 5 stars THEY SOUND GREAT,Scooter,4,"I love the sound quality of these. I use them mostly to listen to music but, they also work well for phone conversations. I also have headphones (different make) and both have sound dampening features. The buds work as well as the over the ear unit. They are easy to connect to whatever device you choose. I have mine linked to my phone and my laptop. The case and the buds both have batteries so if you charge both together, when the buds run out of power you can place them in the case and recharge them without needing to plug in the case.I rated this item 4 stars only because what I bought was used and did not come with the other sizes of ear plugs. And the buds had someone else's settings still installed. I'm not sure that I would have made the purchase if I had know they were used. Amazon did not make it clear that they were used.","Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2024",AHO6M3DEDNJEACWQYFHZXVFDEY6Q,1,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

Also, 1 tap on the right ear bud turns off a podcast, another tap turns the podcast back on. And the noise canceling automatic feature allows me to lower the volume to protect my hearing.When storing the buds in their little case, a small external light illuminates green for ""fully charged"" and red for ""needs charging"".My husband paid about $20 for his ear buds.

The noise cancelling is nice, but don't expect too much out of the noise cancellation feature. If you want better cancellation, you'll need some over the ear units.

The integration with Samsung devices is well thought out, so if you own Samsung devices, these are the way to go.","Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2024",AEKQFAOP7RXTOFDBBX6S4YKW7SEQ,1,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only
R2LMILI3XYE6DJ,B0B2SH4CN6,4.0 out of 5 stars About perfect for wireless headphones.,Crank,4,"For what they are, I think the device is well-engineered. The Pro 2s are high-quality earbuds. You really kind of need the Samsung app for the equalizer and the various settings you get with touch and sound, so make sure to get it. Without the app, I wouldn't really think they are the best choice. But most people will be using these with Galaxy phones. Equalizers per music player, such as VLC, are much better so be sure to use that if you have it to get the best sound.These buds are lighter compared to the previous Pro model. A huge plus. They fit perfectly in my ear almost, and they don't really seem like they will fall out even when running or working harder than normal. I will have to test them for longer lengths of time. So far so good.The packaging and contents are very simple: you get three sets of tips, though, the middle ones are default and worked great, with one smaller cord to charge the magnetic box for storage. It's a grippier, matte texture for the box too. Mine came in a simple plastic bag from Amazon.It is highly recommended you download the Wear app from Samsung. Once you have that they are very easy to set up, and you can constantly monitor whatever you need to with ease. Warranty and registration were a bit harder than I would have liked, but it's doable, not that the warranty is very long on these. You only get a year, and everybody should realize these cannot take many falls. They are very sensitive, so make sure they fit your ears!The features on these are pretty killer all told. I usually turn noise-cancellation off, as it uses too much battery, and I don't really want or need that kind of thing. Ambient sensors when talking are awesome, and the normal isolation is a good space between something like Etymotic in-ear headphones and Sennheiser open-backs. You can fiddle with settings to get your preferences for how you touch and manipulate the device. I found my preferences were quite easy to set up, and the whole thing took about ten minutes.I had no issues with sensitivity on the touch panel area of the earbuds. Works great for me. I do wish these came with a better equalizer, but the Clear setting is probably the most balanced. These are way too bassy out of the gate, and the response is definitely not flat. The Clear setting reduces the bass a bit for a more neutral and even setting with a touch of added treble. I just wish they would let us direct our own EQ options though. Seems like it would be a pretty easy addition to the software. Volume wasn't overpowering at max, but I think it did the job. Again, this is nothing like an amped pair of open-back headphones, so don't expect concert-level sound.AKG has engineered these fairly well in the product space. I'd put them up there with some decent midrange in-ear headphones like the Etymotic ER3XR. There is no way these will compete with any decent open-backs like a Sennheiser HD600 when amped, but I didn't expect that. For what they are, they do the job well, look and feel nice, and the new matte texture is vastly superior and more premium than the first Pro by a mile.All told, if you want to go the wireless earbud route, these are a top option with very few competitors when you take in the whole experience. They won't replace my normal wired headphones at all, but they might be a godsend at work when I just need to chill out and listen to some tunes without the bother of lugging my phone around and wires getting in the way.I don't recommend using these things for hours at a time. There is a serious lack of scientific knowledge on the amount of low-dose radiation over long periods of time. RF, EMR, et cetera. A lot of newer, independent science is starting to find anomalies with oxidation with lower doses and non-ionizing radiation in general. SAR data so far still uses fairly old standards, and though these are a little less powerful in specific absorption rate than a high-end phone, most wear them for WAY longer than that while directly in your ear.If you do need some quality in-ear wireless buds, these are definitely an option to consider. Their SAR data was slightly below the Airpod levels at least. All in all you can't do much better for your wireless audio needs.","Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2022",AH3ICCTF4GUQ75BASLIXFJLPXLQA,1,139,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

The problem was I read in the description that you could connect multiple devices. What they meant was that you can connect several Samsung devices. You can seamlessly move from your Samsung phone to your Samsung tablet. I wanted to connect these to my Samsung phone for phone calls and to my DAP for audio files at the same time. No can do. I also found that it was limited in the touch aspects. You can program the left and right touch and hold to volume or ANC but not both at the same time. For me those two strikes equated to three strikes. I returned them. I have a pair of Jabra active 8 Pro buds that do allow you to connect to multiple devices and have more flexibility in the touch and hold controls.

It seems to loose connection to the charging pads while the case is in my gym bag. The left earbud has never had an issue.2) They are prone to falling out. If I look down after having them in for 30 min, these slip right out. I've had one fall into the sink while washing my hands and another fall onto the sidewalk while reaching down to grab my gym bag. I've even had one fall out while mowing the yard and I wasn't even looking down when that happened.3) The battery life is only so so. Fully charged will only get you a little over 2 hrs of use before you'll have to put them back in the case to start charging again.For the Pros:1) These do a fantastic job at blocking out ambient noise.2) The sound quality is ok for In-Ear.3) The touch controls are a nice feature but I wish were more customizable rather than preset.","Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2024",AESDGMVF336V4LEV2GP646EIRNKA,1,1,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

R30QH4E5NOMRKO,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars In love with my new Buds,S. Strand,5,"These are my first pair of 'unwired' buds. Was using a Bose model previously. I have a Samsung Galaxy S10+, so setting these up was a snap. I literally opened the case and they connected to my phone. I love all of the options for controlling the buds, noise control, voice detect, 360 audio, etc. - they all work spectacularly. The case is the charger which is kinda cool, you can charge the case without the buds and charge the buds without the case being plugged in. They come with different sized covers so you can use the ones that fit your ears the best, and the fit test in the app is a great feature. I do wish they had wings though, I've always had a hard time getting buds to stay in my ears. Overall, I do love them (especially the color ;) ).Couple of minor things to note - obviously none of these were deal breakers for me: 1. The touch sensors are exactly that - touchy. When adjusting them in my ears it's very easy to accidentally change a setting. On the bright side, it's pretty easy to change it back. 2. You can't connect to 2 devices at once, i.e.; phone and laptop. My old buds did and would switch to the active device, so kind of missing that. Connecting them to devices other than the phone is pretty simple, however, and once set up it's just hitting 'Connect' and you're good to go. 3. The charging cable is USB-C to USB-C. I don't have a USB-C compatible charging block and don't want to keep them plugged into my laptop, so I found a USB to USB-C cable and use that. No issues. 4. They are a little uncomfy when trying to get them to sit in my ears correctly. But once seated they do stay pretty snug and I hardly notice them. I use them when running/working out and they haven't fallen out yet. Although I did almost lose one down the garbage disposal today, so take that with a grain of salt 5. SmartThings App. I installed this based on some troubleshooting I was doing with a knockoff pair I bought (didn't realize they were knockoffs at the time). When installed it automatically connected my earbuds to my phone and if I was running my mobile hotspot, it would automatically disconnect the hotspot. A serious pain in the ass since I use that for meetings… it was driving me batty so I uninstalled it. It's not a necessary app for legit buds. 6. I connected these to my laptop and had issues with sound cutting in and out. Found out it is usually related to an out of date Bluetooth driver. So if you are connecting to your laptop and the sound cuts in and out, update your Intel Bluetooth driver - should fix the issue.","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2023",AG4IQ3C7VKE3USVUNWLWNWGJTJEQ,1,29,Color: Bora PurpleStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

I loved them but just figured I would upgrade.The look of the Buds2 Pro is very sleek and better than the live. They're not glossy like the live and the overall design just looks better. However, I had a hard time getting these to fit snug in my ears. When I would finally get them to fit nicely, any movement of my head would loosen them. When I would try to adjust them, obviously I would end up pausing or playing my audio when I didn't want to because I had to touch the ear buds. I just figured maybe my ears needed to get used to them like the buds live. About a month later I'm still struggling with getting them to fit.One feature that I love about the galaxy buds is that I don't have to pause my audio to take them out. I can just take them out of my ears and it will automatically pause. However, with these, I would notice that my audio was still playing when I took them out. I listen to podcasts during the day while I work. I usually only wear one at a time so I can still hear my phone ringing or hear people talking to me. Occasionally I would need to take my ear bud out to answer the phone or talk to someone so I would just set it on my desk in front of me until I could pick it back up. It's easier than trying to put it back in the case for just a minute or 2. Well a lot of the time, I would notice that my ear bud was still playing while it was sitting on my desk in front of me. So, I would have to pause my podcast, take the ear bud out, then make sure my podcast stayed paused. My touch when taking it out would cause it to start playing again. But I couldn't figure out a way to take it out without touching it in a way that would play it.These ear buds are nice and I'm sure they work for people that plan on wearing them for long stretches without taking them in and out. I'm going back to my galaxy buds live and maybe I'll try a different pair another time.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2024",AF67OV74JJEQLEO5D2NPMHB3ALNA,1,2,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

R2K2P9JHQNF6CL,B0B2SH4CN6,"5.0 out of 5 stars Review after 4 months. Great Earbuds, but not perfect.",Jared Armbruster,5,"First for some background, I have owned at least three different pairs of True Wireless Earbuds with ANC: the Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4 Earbuds, and Galaxy Buds Pro 2. I've yet to try any of Jabra's offering and haven't touched Apple Airpods as they have known issues on Android. That said, paired with a newer Samsung phone, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are great. The design and build quality is better than the Galaxy Buds Pro in almost every way. The soft touch finish instead of that annoying glossy design means you're less likely to drop them accidentally while removing them from the case. The case is also conveniently wireless charging or USB Type C Fast Charging. The only thing I don't like about the case is that's it's still a somewhat loose fit for the earbuds, and they need inserted at an angle(by design, but kind of annoying) when putting them back. The fit for me isn't perfect, but I actually find them more comfortable than both the Galaxy Buds Pro and Sony XM4 Earbuds. I hated the glossy finish on the original Galaxy Buds Pro, and the XM4 Earbuds while solid were too large for many users, myself included. These are lighter and more comfortable than either of those two, but it requires messing with it a bit to really get a good seal. If you don't have a Samsung phone, you need to download the Galaxy Wearable App, which allows you to update the firmware(particularly important), adjust EQ, change noise cancelling settings, etc. You can stick with the default EQ, which is overall very balanced, choose another EQ preset, or set your own. They still have Game Mode which I absolutely love, as it keeps input lag to an absolute minimum while playing games like COD Mobile. The ANC is really good, but quite as good as the XM4 Earbuds (TBH it might be a while before anything beats those in ANC). Still very natural sounding Ambient Sound Mode, but then the noise cancelling doesn't nearly block out the entire room like Sony. Sound again is overall very balanced on the default EQ, and I'm quite happy with it. The XM4 Earbuds sounded slightly better, but many users may barely be able to tell the difference if at all, and LDAC never performs as well in terms of latency. I've stuck with the Galaxy Buds Pro 2 due to the better fit over the original Galaxy Buds Pro and Sony XM4 Earbuds, with the fit and seal in particular being my only real gripe. The Game Mode is something more earbuds need to offer at this price point, and it's especially weird for the same company that makes the PlayStation not to have a game mode. On sale the XM4 Earbuds are $10 more than the Galaxy Buds Pro 2, and still lack game mode of any kind. I would still strongly recommend these over the XM4 Earbuds due to the better materials, smaller size, and general comfort. I would especially recommend these if you already have a Samsung phone or tablet, as they pair incredibly well it.","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2023",AEJMJZ2VIV6MGBXMSKHBEV6D7H4Q,1,131,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

I use the large as they keep the buds in my ears. The medium come out after a while. The other issue I have is these love to dissconnect when I move away from the case. I suffered this issue with my cheap pair which is why I moved to a higher end bud with the stated promise these wouldn't do that.

The sound quality is great, but the product as a whole is not the greatest I've owned from Samsung.Battery Life: If you use any of the special features like noise cancellation or ambient sound amplification, you will cut the battery life in two. This is normally not so much of a problem when I go for a two hour run, but when I am working in my garage for 5 - 6 hours, they die before my work is over. Also, unlike previous versions, this earbuds will not give you a sound warning, they will just die.Touch Sensitivity: The one thing that drives me crazy. You will tap these earbuds time after time, after time, and nothing... Previous versions were much more sensitive to touch, which was good if you wanted skip songs, pause/play, etc.Overall, they are good earbuds, but I feel Samsung took a step in the wrong direction compared to the Galaxy Buds 2.

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE APP.I was happy to learn you can connect these buds like any Bluetooth speaker or headphones. If you read the slim instructions with the buds, they direct you to download the app. I did. I uninstalled the app in about 5 minutes.The app requires that you be permitted to access your entire phone - all of it. Call logs, contacts, SMS, and more. IMHO, the app is a dark dank hole that wants access to everything. I did find one feature that requires the app to turn it on. I'll live without that feature.Now, they work great! Seriously nice. They fit well, they have a great sound. They came with a little box of replacement earbud tips (it might have been nice if they were labeled).Another SERIOUSLY GREAT feature is that if you have a compatible phone, you can charge your earbuds on the back of your phone wirelessly.I had to look up the various taps and what they did online. I assume the app would have explained those functions.If Samsung reads this, change the app! I don't want to make a phone call or send a text message with earbuds. I bought them to just listen to music. The app should not require all that permission.

R1TMMXO3INSIOG,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars A journey from Galaxy Buds+ to Galaxy Buds 2 to Galaxy Buds 2 Pro,Jenna Rhine,5,"So here is an initial Day 1 review.I started with the Galaxy Buds+ and was ""generally"" happy. The sound quality was excellent, the volume decent, the phone calls were acceptable and the fit was comfortable and stayed in place (for about 30 minutes) My biggest problem was the ""wings."" They helped the buds stay in place but due to the design, they tended to rotate since they were only being aligned by a tiny plastic nub. And once the wings rotated the fit was horrible.So I eventually upgraded to the Galaxy Buds 2. These also sounded very good, better in fact than the Galaxy Buds+. The calls and audio volume were similar, so perfectly functional. But now I had noise cancelling and a brand new form factor! The noise cancelling worked great for my needs. I'm not flying all over the country, but they nicely limited the white noise of public spaces. Unfortunately the fit was even worse. The Galaxy Buds 2 were slightly oblong in comparison to the Buds+, which I believed would be the answer to the ""wandering wings"" and finally give me the stable fit I'd been looking for. Alas, this was not the case. The only way the buds would stay in my ear is from a friction fit of the cushions in my ear canal. Not comfortable! And if I spoke or chewed food, it was only a matter of seconds before they had worked themselves loose. In every way except fit, the Galaxy Buds 2 were a definite upgrade.Now we arrive at the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. I have had them for about 5 hours and here are my initial impressions:- Getting them in the right orientation took me some time (probably because I'd been historically wearing ear buds goofy just to try to get them to stay in my ear.)- Once I had the ear buds in correctly, the fit was surprisingly comfortable and ""light"" feeling. At first I questioned whether they were positioned properly (the ambient noise being on also added to the idea.) When I turned off the ambient noise I realized how well the buds were fitting.- Chewing and speaking did not disrupt the fit at all!- The ANC worked as expected.- The sound was EXCELLENT in comparison to the previous Buds+ and Buds 2. I found the Buds 2 Pro to be louder, crisper and punchier than the previous earbuds.That's it for now. I'm cautiously optimistic about my purchase and I will follow up in a few weeks with more review. Moving forward I'll be focusing on how easy/hard it will be to quickly position the buds in and how much I end up ""messing with them"" while wearing them.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2023",AH4CNC6Z3U3ET6E4POKZ2TH2XQMQ,1,93,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

R2M9A8TF54GXNP,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Blown away by the sound quality !!,AmazReviewer111,5,"Just got these today, along with the Sony Linkbuds S. My very first bluetooth earbuds. I've mostly used Bose Quiet comfort headphones for the past decade, which I've been thrilled with, they've revolutionized my life. But as I frequently need to take reading glasses on and off, headphones can be inconvenient, and so I wanted an earbuds option.I haven't tested all the features yet, but I'm absolutely gobsmacked by the sound quality of these -- so rich and full. More than enough bass-- in fact I needed to cut it back a bit in the EQ settings (I use the 'clear' mode). Very close to headphone quality, how do they do it??So comfortable to wear too, I can imagine having them in all day. My only complaint is that the ""Wearable app"" you need to get all the features demands a LOT of permissions on your android device, way more than seems necessary and that bothers me. I'll put up with it for now.I initially had some trouble pairing it to multiple devices, but after some fiddling I can switch pretty seamlessly between my galaxy phone, tablet, and Dell computer. Not sure I could write a 'how to' on it, as I seem to have stumbled on 'success' by accident, and the 'youtube' videos on this subject were NOT helpful.Comparing to the Linkbuds S: the sound quality on these is substantially better than the Linkbuds. The linkbuds go more deeply into the ear and feel more 'snug', so I might use those outdoors vs these indoors. I like the fact that via the wearable app, I can set these earbuds to control volume via 'tap and hold'. The Linkbuds don't seem to have this feature, you need to adjust the physical controls on your device to control volume. That's a little ding for the Linkbuds and a huge plus for these, as I like convenient volume adjustment of music above all else.I don't make/receive many phone calls, I mostly listen to music. So can't comment on those features. But if you mostly listen to music as I do, it's hard for me to imagine complaints. Noise cancellation is not as good compared to Bose quiet comfort -- but these are earbuds afterall, and so my expectations for noise cancellation are low, and as I mostly stay home have not had a chance to really test it. But it does do SOMETHING. I think if I were in a high noise environment I'd be inclined to use the headphones.But based on sound quality and comfort alone, I highly recommend! If I were to keep only ONE of the earbud options I'd go with this one.","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2023",AFSPZMQGFOXAOEOIPWNM7XVSDDBA,1,18,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

R1PYMXQW7MNCX2,B0BTYDLTM3,5.0 out of 5 stars WOW. These are only $20??,J.B.,5,"Update 9/12/2024: Stellar customer service from Anker! If I could upgrade my review from 5 stars to 10, I would!So, randomly yesterday I was using my earbuds watching YouTube like I always do, and got a low battery notification. Plugged the case in and put the earbuds away to charge, and decided to get in the shower while they charged up. Came back out to resume watching my show, and for some reason only one earbud connected. Messed around with them for a while trying to get the second one to connect, and even though they both were powered on, I couldn't for the life of me get them to connect at the same time. I checked the paired device list on my phone and ended up noticing that each earbud was showing up as it's own individual device on my Bluetooth list, so my phone would only connect to one at a time. I couldn't get them to reset, unpairing and re-pairing made no difference, restarting my phone made no difference...something was wrong.I emailed Anker customer service, filled out the form on their website and provided a screenshot of my Amazon order, the order number, and the device serial number on the back of the case. They suggested some things to try (all of which I had already done), and when none of that worked, they apologized for the problems and agreed to replace my earbuds 100% free of charge! The rep said I should have a new pair within 5 business days. I got a shipping confirmation this morning...and guys, I had brand new set of earbuds this afternoon! Less than 24 hours after filing a ticket, they had replacements in my hands. That is absolutely STELLAR customer service for a $20 pair of earbuds! Now read the original review below, and order these with confidence. It's unfortunate that mine had such a random and wonky issue, but trust that Anker will take care of you if necessary. Thanks for reading!---------original review----------Ok, first of all, I don't buy expensive earbuds. Never have, never will. I like good sounding music but I'm not an audiophile, I have kids and dogs, I travel for work occasionally, things get lost, etc. I've been using Boltune BT-BH020's for the last several years with a lot of success. Good sound quality, nice little magnetic case, USB-C charging, etc. My wife and I both have 2 pairs each, and they were about $35 a pair the last time we bought some. One pair finally crapped out on me so I went to order another set, and unfortunately they no longer exist. Not surprising considering the lifespan of cheaper Chinese brands on Amazon, but I was still a little disappointed.I liked the form factor of the Boltune case so I started looking for similar options, and landed on the Anker Soundcore P20i. I have always had good luck with Anker chargers and accessories in the past, so I was expecting a good, simple set of earbuds for $20, but nothing fancy. I tell you what though, I'm pretty blown away with what you get with these - easily the best ""budget"" level earbuds I've ever used.Packaging is typical Anker - excellent. Well put together, well protected. The earbud case itself is just slightly smaller than my old Boltune cases, but it comes with an attached lanyard, and has a notched area in the front for ease of opening - something that Boltune never got quite right (opening those cases was always a PITA, especially in the dark). Operation is simple - open the case and the earbuds power on (they will automatically go into device pairing mode if they haven't been paired yet). Return the earbuds to the case and close it to power them down and recharge. A couple additional sets of different sized earbud inserts are included so you can find the size that works best for your ears, as well as a 6"" USB-C charging cable and a well written instruction manual. Of note, Anker placed plastic covers over the charging prongs to keep them from being damaged in shipping or powering on accidentally and draining the batteries - a nice touch. The case battery was almost fully charged upon arrival and only took about 10 minutes to top off, and the earbuds showed 100% via the app right out of the box (more on the app in a second).Once paired, the sound quality is fantastic, especially at this price point. They easily outperform my other earbuds, especially in the low end. Mids and highs are crisp without being screechy or piercing. I can't really comment on bluetooth range as my phone is usually in my pocket while I'm mowing the lawn or working in the garage, so I've never really needed to test that aspect. Battery life is advertised as 10 hours on the earbuds alone without charging them at all, and 30 hours if you return them to the case to recharge between uses. I haven't had to recharge the case yet so I can't confirm that, but I have no reason to doubt that they'll work as advertised. They also say that ten minutes of charging will get you 2 hours of listening time, so these thing would be great for the airport even if you forgot to charge them beforehand and only have a few minutes between flights.What really sets these things apart though? The app! It is well designed, obviously created by native English-speaking developers, and is simple and intuitive to use. The first time I synced the earbuds to the app, I got an alert for a firmware update! I've NEVER had a cheap pair of earbuds that had that kind of support from the manufacturer - really awesome to see. Going beyond that, you can see the battery level for each earbud, configure the sound profile you prefer, turn on a bass boost if that's your thing, you can configure the left and right touchpads on the earbuds to do the function of your choice (answer, hang up, go forward one track, go back one track, etc) - and there's even a device locator that will play a loud high-pitched beep through the earbud of your choice if you accidentally drop one and can't find it. That feature alone is worth it's weight in gold - I can't tell you how many times I've dropped an earbud off of my nightstand and had to root around looking for the stupid thing, lol.All in all, I'm really impressed with these for the money. Hands down the best earbuds I've ever owned, and they are the cheapest so far! Well done, Anker!Also - I'm not a bot, not a shill, and nobody paid me to say this. Just a happy, human customer who's impressed with the product!","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",AF62ZML4IMZ4WOAV4IY6BNO6XZGA,1,362,Color: Black
REYFNA6GHKCQ0,B0BTYDLTM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Far exceeds the quality expected at the price point!,Dylan,5,"So after going back and forth on whether I wanted to spring for high end $200+ earbuds or just get a budget pair and hope they were good enough, I decided to order two different pairs in the $20-30 range: These Anker Soundcore P20i's and a random cheap pair that seems to be marketed under a bunch of different random brand names (the ones I got were Sajawass), but which had a perfect 5 star rating.Upon receiving both, I immediately needed to compare and decide which pair I would be keeping. I tried the Soundcore P20i's first. As others mentioned, the sound profile is quite bass heavy, but not muddy as I expected. To my pleasant surprise, the overall clarity and quality was quite good! Would have thought these were something near the $60-80 price point. What's even better is once I used their in app EQ to tone down the bass (using bass reducer or treble booster setting), they were actually quite nice. Now, from a musician and audiophile standpoint, I can tell you that these are nowhere near hitting that mark, but still great for affordable everyday use! When I tested the other brand of earbuds I bought, I immediately knew these P20i's were the clear winner! The other ones sounded like the cheap wired buds you might buy in-flight if you forgot your own. They left the soundstage very empty and flat with no spatial separation and absolutely no bass!Pairing was simple and I've been able to maintain connection while walking into other rooms without taking my phone with me. I also like that you can customize the touch controls to do what you want. Call quality was also great. The person I called said they could hear me clearly. Granted, I was in a quiet setting, so that may or may not be the case in a noisy environment.All in all, at the $20-30 price point, these P20i's are an absolute steal! If you're not in need of ultra high-end sound or active noise canceling, but still want pretty good sound at a crazy affordable price, these are the buds to get!","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2024",AFXVTJO6LHEJ4R6C6QS6OI3KSDMQ,1,7,Color: Black

Normally I use AirPods Pro’s but I lost the original case and bought a replacement, not from Apple, that has messed up after 2 months twice. I love Anker products so I figured I’d give these a try since they cost less than a replacement AirPods charger.First impressions were that it’s kind of a bulky case and it’s hard opening with one hand. Just a slight inconvenience. The fitting is pretty good. I’ve worn these for hours without much discomfort. My ears get sweaty so they slip out a bit but I just push them in a bit and I’m good to go. ( heres a tip: download soundcore app and set both ear controls for one tap to “nothing”. Helps avoid accidentally activating a function if you’re just adjusting your earbuds)There battery seems to last for ever! Even the case charges them up super fast! They sound great! Bluetooth connects smoothly and instantly with my iPhone 13 Pro. I have no complaints about quality. I haven’t accidentally dropped them yet but they seem to hold pretty good inside the case if you opened the case and try to shake them out.Overall they do what they are meant to do. Sound good, connect easy, last a long time, charge fast. If you don’t need anything fancy like noise canceling and noise pass through then this is a very good option to check out.

R2HJ7EB356L669,B0BTYDLTM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Works great!,Lorien,5,"I made the (incredibly stupid) decision to work remotely for three days while simultaneously chaperoning a school sports championship trip. I have a Jabra headset that I normally use, but I needed something smaller due to limited packing space.I saw the reviews, features, and price on these and decided to give them a try, and I am so glad I did. I go into detail below, but bottom line: these are great travel headphones and worth every penny, and I liked them so much I actually bought a second pair.Microphone: people on the other end said my voice sounded a little funny. However, I was making these calls from the hallway just above the arena(the quietest place I could find in the stadium), and everyone could hear and understand what I was saying despite the nonstop cheering, announcing, other people’s conversations, and general overall noise level.Speaker: just as amazingly, I could hear the people on the other end. The sound came through just about as clearly as my normal headset and I had no trouble listening to my regular meetings, even when my kids’ team was on the field and I would have preferred to be listening to that. Even more impressively, I usually only wore one at a time so I could keep an ear on the kids I was supposed to be watching, and I was still able to hear just fine most of the time.Comfort: I usually hate earbuds. I don’t know if I have weirdly shaped ears or what, but generally after about 30 minutes my ears start to hurt and I have to take them out. I kept one of these in my ear all day from roughly 8 am to 4 pm, and they didn’t bother me at all. I honestly forgot I was wearing them sometimes. These also came with 3 sizes of ear cups, which I appreciate.Other features: The case has magnets to hold the earbuds snugly, and closes with a satisfying click. The little loop was convenient for hooking to a belt loop or my bag. The battery lasts a long time, I was talking all day and barely dented the battery life.Bottom line, take it from me: these earbuds are great, and don’t try to work while you’re chaperoning a school trip.","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2024",AG4DDQDXNKIN6MMZ76YXQT6VOQJQ,1,8,Color: Blue

R2HFE6XDWUPYO8,B0BTYDLTM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent,Austin,5,"I'll echo what other reviews have said - the Soundcore P20i earbuds are an excellent value!I have more sets of headphones/earbuds than I care to admit, but I somehow manage to talk myself into buying another pair every so often. With these, the excuse I made for myself was that I didn't have a decent pair of Bluetooth earbuds. I had a set of cheap BT earbuds that I picked up from a local convenience store a couple years ago, but I never really liked them that much and so rarely used them, which meant the battery was always dead whenever I did need them. By the time the battery was done charging, I didn't need to use them anymore, so they would sit on the shelf for a month until I needed them again, at which point the battery was dead again, and so on...I thought maybe if I had a decent pair that I liked better, I would actually use them more often and wouldn't run into that same cycle of frustration. I was thinking about getting a pair of premium buds that everyone seems to have these days, but was hesitant to drop ~$200 on something that could still wind up sitting in a drawer 95% of the time. I stumbled onto these and thought the $20 price tag seemed perfect, especially seeing as Soundcore is a division of/owned by Anker. I love Anker's products, so I figured these would be good quality, so I could see how they work out and decide if I wanted to spring for a more expensive upgrade later on (or if my aversion is just to wireless buds in general and save myself $180).Well, I've had these for a couple months now and they ended up being even better than I expected. I'm sure better quality could be had, but it's hard to beat the value you get with these. They sound great, connect easily, and stay in my ears (for the most part). I don't use them every day, but that's mainly because I have a wife and young kids that are frequently trying to get my attention, and these block too much external sound to hear them well (hitting pause and asking ""What did you say?"" every 10 seconds is more frustration for everybody than it's worth, haha). Just using one earbud works as a workaround, but still, I'd prefer to have music in both ears if I can.Side story - I know it's stupid, but I have a weird habit of squirrelling away expensive stuff. Instead, I am naturally inclined to use a cheaper, not-so-nice variant in my regular routine, I guess in a backwards way of trying to keep my nice things nice. These earbuds are such good quality that I find myself wanting to ""save"" them and keep them hidden away. Moral of the story, the quality definitely seems like a notch above my expectations for this price point, which is a great thing!If you're looking for a decent pair of wireless earbuds that won't break the bank, these are an excellent option. I am very pleased with my purchase - it was well worth it!","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AH7URACIQPATOXB5GBOAVMCOTMSA,1,207,Color: Black
R2UZ6VA7QIQGUB,B0BTYDLTM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Best earbuds for the price I've seen,Jared M King,5,"I was looking for a set of wireless earbuds to use mostly with my Windows PC, and after trying some others that had some frustrating issues these seemed worth a try even though they're surprisingly cheap. I was guessing that many of the ratings for these may not be legit, but after trying the earbuds I can confirm they're as good as the ratings indicate.The case itself feels cheap, which is what you would expect for earbuds at this price range, but the lid closes solidly and feels nice, and it has USB-C and a charging light on the front (where it should be). The earbuds themselves are decent feeling matte plastic with round silicone tips, and I'm happy to report that they're comfortable even after an hour of wearing them. This is definitely not true for other earbuds I've used so I was surprised at how good they feel for the price.Audio quality wise, they're decent. Nothing special but pretty good considering the price range. If you really care about music quality you should look at a more expensive pair, but for everything else they've been great. The Soundcore app for iOS is also very good and lets you customize the touch functions on each earbud, which is super helpful if you want to disable single touches and avoid accidentally triggering actions. The only thing I wish it would let you do is enable/disable Game Mode using a touch function, but I can live without this.Overall, Anker did a nice job with these. I don't think you can find a better pair of truly wireless earbuds for the price.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2024",AG4YJ6R5H6AVUVMIYKMCRF3OXNCQ,1,8,Color: Black
R1UILHXE37P4CS,B0BTYDLTM3,3.0 out of 5 stars You get what you paid for,Mike,3,"I wanted to get a pair of earbuds that were wireless because I was tired of the constraints and nuisances of wired, and headphones are uncomfortable and mess with my OCD too much.These seemed to posess all the features and qualities I was looking for, and it did deliver. I don't think that these are garbage, but I definitely don't think 40$ is a price befitting for cheap Dollar Store earbuds; I will explain what I mean.Firstly, the base sound profile - it's terrible. I am no audiophile, but I do have some standards. They are not drowned in mud like my previous Monster Achieve Airlinks, but still very flat and lacking body.The soundstage/spatial sound is decent; it fills the stereo appropriately, but don't expect to feel it project.The buds come with a companion app which allow you to use different EQ presets (my personal favorites are Piano or Accoustic, which help bring the sound up a bit). These presets also program into the buds, meaning if you connect them to your PC or another device, they will still retain the preset. My only gripe is that when you use solo bud mode (which I do a lot while at work for environmental awareness), it will not activate; you need to have both buds connected for it to activate, which to me makes no sense.The fit is something I cannot get really comment positively on. I have had these for a month and while the right bud is secure, I can never get the left one to secure, no matter how much I fasten it nor what eartip sizes I use. Though this may be a fault of my canal shape. The comfort otherwise is very good.Battery life is great. They come with a 10 hour charge and a case that holds up to 30 I believe. I use these for work and then take them home and use them for my PC, which the buds are fully charged for by then.The touch controls are responsive, albeit difficult to get right as I can't always tap correctly due to not knowing where my finger is in relation to the bud (though this just may be a me thing). You can also change the taps/holds for one or both buds, amd program them to do different things - I like having single tap for play/pause, double-tap to skip forward, and long press for Assistant.The verdict in general - I think they are a decent humble pair of earbuds not trying to present themself as anything extraordinary, however I would not recommend them for audiophiles, unless you love bass and know how to EQ to your preference.","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2024",AGJ7T4EKXU2SH7C6UENS4RUL6MCQ,1,27,Color: Black
RXORUIJ6STGF8,B0BTYDLTM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Very impressed!,Ania,4,"I am an earbud snob and an audiophile, and I am VERY impressed with these earbuds.On one hand, you get what you pay for, as there is no ambient sound or noise blocking function. So you get the almost-forgotten sensation of something blocking your hearing when you put these earbuds in -- you know, the way they all felt before we got spoiled with the ANC/Ambient Sound functions on the more modern and expensive earbuds. But. You get excellent sound and a very good mic. For $20!! (I got it on discount).Here are all the CONS I've noticed so far:- Ergonomic, very comfortable and snug in the ear. I often have a problem with that (narrow ear channel, sensitive ears). No issue here. Very comfy. Not falling out.- The mic catches my voice well, people are hearing me quite well on phone calls.- The quality of the equalizer is impressive.- The Bluetooth connection was fast and seamless.- I love the bass on these!- Listening to music is really pleasant, there is no excessive treble, the bass is deep and juicy, and there is a selection of pre-set equalizers for different music genres. (In the app.)IMPORTANT: You get a whole bunch of additional perks if you install the Soundcore app. They have a huge selection of ambient sounds and white noise, as well as customization of touch controls and a few other helpful features including access to customer service through the app.UPDATE:Two cons discovered so far:- Audio connection seems to have a lag at the start of a phone call. People have told me they can barely hear me, and then in a few seconds said it was fine now.- They seem to pick up external noises better than my own voice in noisy surroundings, like transport or in the street. That's unfortunate, because I primarily need earbuds on the go, not while I'm at my desk in a quiet office.","Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2024",AGP7KK3LI2G67HC5WUX6UQGP7W3Q,1,1,Color: White
R52KZ2TU22NVH,B0BTYDLTM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars For the price, what’s not to like. - EDITED",MannyB,4,"2nd Edit -> It is refreshing when a manufacturer stands behind their product. Although I the performance in an environment with Bluetooth interference was disappointing, Anker reached out to be and addressed the situation. Excellent customer support!Edited -> When I reviewed this initially, I had one issue that I considered to be so niche as to not affect my rating. When connected to a Garmin Forerunner watch AND using an ANT + heart rate strap and an ANT + foot pod, there were such frequent dropouts as to be unusable. Given that a watch isn't the most powerful Bluetooth transmitter/receiver and ANT + operates at 2.4GHZ while making no attempt to respect the Bluetooth protocol, I wasn't overly surprised. Other earbuds have had an occasional dropout (one or two an hour) in this situation of interference. I then used these earbuds with my phone with no issues until ..... I went to the gym. In the gym, with many many other people wearing Bluetooth headphones, there were a significant number of dropouts. Out of curiosity, I then wore them connected to my phone but while running with the Garmin watch and ANT + accessories and it was unusable. I am therefore convinced that these earbuds do not do well in an environment with 2.4GHZ interference. Considering many would like to use these in an environment like a gym, I am forced to reduce the rating by two stars.**********************************************************************************************************************We are in the price range of cheap wired earbuds almost here….

I purchased my first Soundcore earbuds since 2019. I’ve tried other brands of earbuds but always go back to Anker. Set up is easy, connecting to the Bluetooth is seem less and hassle-free! The Anker earbuds are noise canceling headphones. There is no noise leakage no matter how high the volume (trust me I’ve tried to find a missing earbud by turning the volume all the way up in a completely quiet room & still couldn’t find the earbud)!! 🤣 I use the Souncore P20i to connect to the work desktop so I can listen to my favorite DVD documentaries or Netflix documentaries or stand-up shows while I work. Charging is quick and a full charge will last up to 8 hours. I have recommended Anker products to all my coworkers and friends. Prices are midrange to expensive, I stay at the midrange end as I sometimes tend to loose my earbuds 😂 . So far I have both the Liberty Neo & Life A1 in my work bag just in case I accidentally leave one at home or at work. I always like to have a back up! I also have the Anker Soundcore A20i True Wireless Earbuds in my weekend bag when I go to do laundry. My first & favorite will always be the Liberty Neos which I have in my nightstand to listen to ASMR YouTube videos to sleep and to block out Fourth of July fireworks! 😩Phone calls are crisp and clear on my end however my BFF complains that she can hear me AND all the background noise!

R29SVXOKHV08H8,B0BTYDLTM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Great For Use With Google Pixel 6a,Kyle Leroux,4,Very good Bluetooth Earbuds overall. Works and sounds great with Audible and Spotify on my Google Pixel 6a while working out or going for a walk and works fine with Hulu Plus as well for watching my favorite TV shows at the local coffee shop. I have used the mic for video calls on Facebook Messenger and the person on the other side said they could hear me clearly. My only complaint is the fact the it comes with a dinky 5 inch long USB C to USB A charging cable that was way too short to be of much use and did feel a little flimsy and cheap but the fact that it uses the USB C standard for charging means you can use any other USB C charger you have laying around such as my Samsung brand Adaptive Fast Charger with a 5 ft cord that came with my old Samsung Galaxy A20 Smartphone that my Pixel 6a replaced. Other than that not a bad product for the price but I recommend getting a longer USB C cable and wall charger for additional convenience if you don't have one. If you do use the USB C to USB A cable included a USB port or charger capable of at least 5 volts 2 amps will work best.,"Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2024",AGRZZN3USJM2A4RDWX7TPR53PJ2A,1,1,Color: Black
RAYCNHZT4S9DS,B0BTYDLTM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Good enough for my limited needs,LaVonia Green,4,"I’ll be the first to admit I’m not an earbud person. Mostly because they ALL hurt my ear canals. I don’t care how small, how padded or of what material, they hurt. The only solution is a pair I have that sit just outside the ear. Of course you give up sound quality but that’s ok. I’d rather not be totally tuned out of my environment and be able to carry on a conversation without removing them than fumble around taking them out if approached. I’m also not concerned at all with sound quality. If I can hear the sound clearly and loud enough I’m happy. I, at this point in time, only use them when watching a movie on my phone while laying on my couch at home. So I don’t have a huge need for them. With all this being said, I am interested in expanding their use as I’ve always wondered why everyone is walking around with 1 earbud in constantly. What are they listening to that’s so important that they can’t be without it on all the time? Then I thought maybe they are also for phone calls though I’ve never taken a call using earbuds. I seldom answer the phone either. Big surprise right? So I saw these and at their price point I thought I would give them a try. While I like mine that sit outside the ear they are very light and could fall off and I’d never know unless they were in use. They also sit at the exact location on my ear that my glasses are already utilizing so they again, aren’t as secure as they could be. These should be more stable if nothing else. They paired easily and charged with no problem. However, they still literally make my ears sore even after they are removed. I must just have extremely small canals. But they are stable and I would know if one came out which was my concern. As far as all the tuning I just get them to a place the bass isn’t thumping or overwhelming and I’m good. But there are lots of adjustments that can be controlled via the app. I’m not crazy about controls on the buds as I never get the reaction I intended so if I do need to make an adjustment it’s easier for me to just grab my phone and do it. The other thing I don’t understand is why advertisers say the charging case extends playtime. No it doesn’t. If it did, to me that would mean they could remain in my ears for a longer amount of time before they run out of charge. Taking them out to put them in the case to charge is no different than using a charger other than you don’t have to be plugged in. So nothing extends battery life because once they are charged, they are charged. They can’t charge any further. It bothers the hell out of me that this is said and people must believe it, but it’s simply not true. If there’s some magic I’m missing regarding charging cases someone please correct me. These certainly last long enough for me to watch a movie and I put them back in the magic case after use and then typically plug it all in anyway so I seldom hear the Low Battery warning. I keep them charged because I don’t want to want to use them and they die in the middle of my movie, you know, because that extended battery life didn’t work out for me, and I don’t want want to wait even the 10 minutes for the 2 hours of battery life they are advertised to gain in that time span of charging. When I want them, I want them now. But I would prefer a simple tone alert instead of words.m if the battery does go low. I haven’t started using them more than my other ones yet because honestly, I’m a little self conscious, but when I do, I will use these because of the stability factor. I know earbuds can be super expensive and these are not, but I believe they are of better quality than their price would suggest. I can’t think of anything I would want them to do that isn’t already being done. Or honestly, what others might want out of them lol. Definitely recommend them.","Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2024",AHHEWKHUTFVNP2PYVIRXIVKCE5NA,1,10,Color: Black

Now it's only been one day, but the build quality is exceptional as well, and I'm anticipating being able to enjoy these for a long time to come. I can't believe I spent less than $20 for these. I'm just some retired dude who rarely feels like he got his money's worth these days. Maybe $20 - $30 for something like this is no big deal for some people. But I've spent plenty more on similar products in the past and didn't get any better sound quality or build quality. Who knows they may just burn out in a year. But my guess is they'll be with me for a while more than that.

I already assumed it was broken. There was not way. If the water didn't brake it for sure the heat from the dryer would have killed it. NOPE!!! No issues at all! Charges fine. Connects immediately. It works... Yeah yhe mic sucks. It pics up everything. But im not buying a $20 dollar headset and expect $100 quality but I will say if im in a quite area I can whisper and it pics it up. Great for my therapy appointments as I have to take them at work where people can hear what i am saying. The sound is great. Deep bass. Clear voices. Just make sure you put them in properly. I really suggest you get these and invest in memory foam ear things. They fit better and stay on better. It also helps to seal in your ear correctly.,"Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2024",AHLOU6NMILFAB3MQ76ZWVTBAUWLA,1,5,Color: Blue
R3DDAN7J8GNFF7,B0BTYDLTM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Sound is distorted with high bass,Ken-L,4,"Sound quality is okay, there's some distortion in the sound quality. I have another pair of soundcores which dont have this problem. These things have a lot of bass, a little too much in my opinion. The clarity of the music is obviously distorted even more as you turn up the volume, and the bass becomes uncomfortable over 60%. I usually bump the volume to 60%-65% when working out to get my last set in when I'm tired. I cant do that with these as the bass is too loud. I had to download the app to reduce the bass which was easy though. After reducing the bass the sound distortion is much better. But the sound quality doesn't feel too crisp. I would say this step is a necessity or the sound quality is pretty bad.Fit is amazing though - Small, light, and doesn't slip out easily for my ears. These are probably the best feeling ear buds I've worn so far. (8th pair of ear buds I've owned, all different kinds). The package only came with 2 sizes of silcone ear pieces so not for people with extra large ears canals.Controls - if you download the app it allows you to set the tap controls which is very convenient. Each ear has 3 touch options, tap, double tap, and hold.I don't plan to make calls with these so I can't speak for that usage.The case is nice and compact and came with a ""wrist"" strap. Its more like a finger strap, just enough to help hold on to it. Would have been nice if it was larger and adjustable to fit on the wrist.","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2024",AF76DCO6W2UVYP7XOA6JW2ISKCMQ,1,8,Color: White

Tried them out of curiosity, and was shocked at how great the sound was AND for only $20! Bought another immediately to be used as a spare when I don’t want to use my expensive AirPod Pro’s when playing my Steam Deck.Insane how far technology has come. I’ve always been a huge fan of Anker products for years now and they continue to always be my default for both performance to price ratio.These buds look, feel, fit, bass and sound great. They do not sound nor look cheap IMO. I would say these rival the AirPods (Non-Pro) from the perspective of a non-audiophile individual. I do not care about the lack of ANC or Transparency mode for this. I have my AirPods for that. A bonus is how these can be used with the Anker Soundcore app to modify the sound equality.Worth it. I highly recommend if you are looking for something that is affordable without sounding like crap.Note: Didn’t use the mic, but I’m sure it’s decent and more than enough for your basic needs.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2024",AHB6LENRUEIJBAUXSK2FWTRQABLA,1,2,Color: Black

R2Q7PURJBGMO2R,B0BTYDLTM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good earbuds,Steve Irwin,4,"I ordered these ear buds a couple of months ago to replace my ""Soundcore by Anker Life A1 True Wireless Earbuds"" because the cover over the pause button on the one of those that I used most had borken off. I have to say that the sound on the A1 model was better, probably in part because they more fully fill the ear and block out more of the ambient sound. But these are handy to pop in and take out thanks to the antenna stub that sticks out of the ear, which functions as a handle and you don't have to mess with that removable elastic piece on the top of the A1 that can come loose in the process of removing the earbud from your ear. What I find most inconvenient about this set is the lack of a pause/stop button. The manual says that you can pause the audio with a double tap at the top end of the antenna stub. I have only been able to get that to work for me on a few occasions. Most of the time, it doesn't function. Perhaps there is some very specific way of tapping it that I haven't discovered, or maybe I should be doing the second tap faster or slower. I have tried it a variety of ways, but it's very hit and miss, mostly miss. At this point, I'm tired of trying and I've pretty much given up on getting it to work, so I just pull out my phone and hit pause on the podcast or music playing screen.","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2024",AH3GDD2YXMX4CWUHOY73V7GQ7X4A,1,0,Color: Black

I use the app which I love and carries over from precious products that I have purchased from the already. This is the p20 and 30i side by side for comparison. Noticed everything is pretty much the same size wise. Sound wise though if definitely different. Which makes it seem more involved when setting up the eq, since I prefer bass and need to make it up in the adjustments. I just ordered some memory foam tips so I will update th8s with the ones I get and how they work. Definitely would recommend over any other similar brands I have puchased including the nonsound cancelling beats or first iterations of the air pods. More to come. Also with everything being said I would get the 30s overt the 20s but if you are looking to save the money I would sweat the difference, the 20s are still an amazing deal.

These earbuds deliver outstanding sound quality and the directions were simple and easy to understand. The audio experience is great to use for listening to music. While outdoor running, there was still enough sound breakthrough that I could hear environmental factors around me for safety.However, there’s a notable caveat for those with smaller ears. The fit might be a bit cumbersome, as the earbuds tend to be on the larger side. I found that they didn’t sit as snugly in my ears as I’d hoped, which isn’t uncommon for smaller ears. When it comes to using them during workouts, they shine during indoor strength training. They stay relatively secure and provide an excellent soundtrack to your exercise routine. But for outdoor running or high-impact sports, I’d recommend looking for something more compact and stable. The larger size and fit issues might cause them to fall out or need to be readjusted frequently.Overall, I’m happy with the purchase but might look for something different for high impact sports.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AH4M523II37P3KTR35NVXARBLM6A,1,2,Color: Blue

When you put them in the case they turn off, but randomly (sometimes hours later) they will reconnect to my phone, hence subtracting a star from my rating. They do come with three sizes of earbuds to accommodate various people. I tried them all and they will still fall out when I am sweating or when talking or eating/chewing.

RJATZAKWQUIZT,B0BTYDLTM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good.,Geoff W,4,"The media could not be loaded. Looks good, secure in case, easy to grab and go, good sound, and fits in my ears. There are bud options for different ear sizes. Both buds are independent, so you can use either solo and there is no lag when you case one and not the other.Worst part are the controls. They just had to be different. Instead of using the tried and true (one touch answer/hang up/pause/play, two touch skip, three touch back.) They use a ridiculous one touch answer/hang up, two touch play/pause, long hold right skip, long hold left back.So there is a delay in the touch. Like a half second. It's like touch-pause-beep. So if you just want to play music you can't touch before the beep or it won't read. Example, if you go touch-touch-beep, it will register as one touch. But you can't be too slow, if you wait and go touch beep touch beep, it may register as one and one (not two together). So you have to practice the timing to get it to touch beep/touch beep. Was this annoying to read? Wait til you do it.So the long press skip/back. Sometimes I'm rocking out and someone talks to me, so I pop one out in my hand and leave the other in. Well, holding it may register as a long touch so while you're talking, the song is skipping in your ear. Guys - this doesn't need to be like this. Just copy bose and get it right.If you're reading this far and thinking ""I don't care about all this"", then these are 5 star buds. Also, it only took me a day to learn the timing, so not too bad. I wanted CHEAP buds that play well and don't lose connection easily and that's what I got.

R3CBJUWQU4WUKT,B0BTYDLTM3,"5.0 out of 5 stars Out of the box, impressed ... at least at this price point.",Alysa,5,"I had doubts. I was replacing my beloved Liberty 2 Pro buds (an encounter with the washing machine ended them), and I didn't have the same budget. The P20i buds are definitely cheaper-feeling plastic, lighter weight, and the case feels cheaper. I saw that they had customizable EQ and I confused that with the HearID, which they do NOT have.That said, I have Auditory Processing Disorder (APD/CAPD), so clarity is a really big deal for me, and that's something I'm definitely getting out of these earbuds right now. I wish I could raise the bass a little regardless of EQ setting, but that's not going to be a thing. It's just the choice of presets. The acoustic, suprisingly, is the most balanced. That hasn't been the case with a lot of preset EQs I've tried in the past 20s years.So far I've tried them on classical, heavy metal, power metal, classic pop rock and soft rock, 2000s alternative, modern and classic EDM, and classic Broadway. They get the job done nicely. Nothing sounds lost or muddled, at least on the Acoustic setting. I just wish they had adjustable treble and bass. I mean really. This is a super basic feature to offer. You don't need the fancy HearID for basic EQ sliders. The sound is so close. A tiny tweak and it would be perfect.That said, I've bought earbuds at this price point that were destined for the trash, so these are quite nice for what they are.I don't like the touch buttons. I like tactile buttons. Especially on a thing that's in my ears and I can't actually see. But they're adjustable in the same Soundcore app I used for my Liberty 2 Pros, so that's a plus. At least I can set them to do what I want them to instead of having to learn a new system every time I buy a pair of buds.I can't speak to the sound-cancelling ability until I try them at work. I work in a blue collar environment with loud machinery (PSA: Never, nevernevernever use earbuds while working around heavy machinery, that's just dangerous. You have to be able to hear your coworkers and machine cues so you can react immediately when something goes wrong. Please stop. Thanks.). The persistent mechanical din cuts into break areas, which are small and also noisy with people and other sounds, and it can be hard for me to really unwind on my breaks.I have other Neurodivergencies, so this is a pretty big deal. Some days I can tune it out, and some days it's a sensory nightmare I can't escape from for 12 hours. I will update when I've had the chance to test these earbuds in this setting.While writing this review, I've noticed that the P20is tend to either be too loud or too soft on certain tracks, especially rock. This isn't bothering me on Pearl Jam, but Disturbed was kinda earsplitting (I still have near-perfect hearing, somehow, so this might not bother you). I tried to make a fine adjustment in my phone, and I don't know if this is a phone thing or an earbud thing. I can usually get better volume tuning out of my computer, so it might just be my phone, but I don't recall having this issue with the Liberty 2 Pros.I've started noticing things I hadn't before on certain tracks, like background vocalizations on Golden Earring's Twilight Zone or subtleties in Depeche Mode's A Question of Lust, so another point for clarity. Wow. I'm reminded that some tracks are meant to be turned up, and have a more muddled nature in their original recordings because they were meant to be disruptive, so I suppose it is what it is. APD is fun. The struggle is real. :/I need a better budget, but again, for what they are they're getting the job done nicely. I'm not sending them back. When I get better earbuds, I'll keep them as backups.","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2023",AHZLBTN5OCHI5NHDDVU4YBZEUFTQ,1,127,Color: Blue

This is extremely helpful for me, so I know the darker ones are my son's, the brighter colors are mine. They are comfortable to wear. I have had some issues with two pairs that sometimes people can't seem to hear me well and I have to stop using them. That does get frustrating. It's not all the time.I love that the case charges, and shows you what % of the battery is left. I can charge it up, throw the case in my purse. Then be using them while I'm out, and stick them in the case when I'm done, and they will charge in the case in my purse so they can have a full battery when I need them later in the day.My 2 frustrations - wish the charging port was just the same on all headphones, instead of having to search for the right ones.My biggest frustration - I own multiple pairs. Sometimes they will auto pair to my phone, most times they wont. When I look at my phone bluetooth options to pair them, I have like five listed of them. I wish you could somehow name them. I never know which one is which so I have to go through each one since they are all titled the same thing. Sometimes if I am on them they will suddenly pair with a different device.Overall, when they go on sale they are totally worth buying. I'm pretty frugal, so I'm not one to pay the higher price that these are listed at.

R33PCK6I70B0G3,B09FLNSYDZ,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent buy for the price - wouldn't pay more though,Ozan,4,"- Connectivity: no issues- Comfort: You get used to them. If it's the first time you're using this type of ear buds, it may feel a bit bulky.- Appearance: Could care less when I'm in the gym. Functionality is more important.- Range: No issues, phone is always close by.I hate when my ear buds pop out in the middle of workouts. So I thought I'd get a pair of these. I paid only 29.99 + tax so it was a decent buy. Sound level at max is just ""ok"". The gym I go to has a bunch of big screen TVs with Fox news and generic mainstream (terrible) music playing. Mental isloation is a must with also a bunch of people slamming weights and making all kinds of noises.The sound on these ear buds at highest level is right at the threshold of blocking outside noise, so it does the job.On the other hand, the sound quality isn't that great. The sound is unpolished and dry compared to the philips, jabra or the toro pairs I own. I listen to metal at the gym and I like it loud as hell so I switched back to my philips pair.So, this may be an inexpensive solution for you if you don't require very loud music and aren't an absolute snob about sound quality like me- the sound on these isn't really bad, it's just not great. I didn't add photos, the product looks just like in the sale listing.It may sound funny but I might look for an Ipod mini or equivalent with 3.5mm out. They had great sound quality and high output. I don't like carrying my big old Samsung Galaxy22 around in the gym.If this was an expensive set, I'd probably give no more than 2 stars but for the price and tier, they'll get 4 stars for the nice charging case and different size inserts for adjustability.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AES56QHJKEDRU2TXAFKLSF45AJKQ,1,35,Color: Black

R2GCJQXVC8XBPY,B09FLNSYDZ,5.0 out of 5 stars LOVE THESE - GREAT GIFTS,Donna,5,"These earbuds are the VERY FIRST that totally stay in place and in my opinion fit perfectly on any ear as the wrap around the outside of the ear is flexible (and so comfortable). I have very small ear canals and I can't say how many other earplugs over the YEARS I've bought that just won't stay in my ears. I had honestly given up until this pair - for some reason, I took another chance as I listen to audiobooks and I can't play them in waiting rooms or wherever vs read and you get the gist. I was ecstatic. I'm taking forever to write this review so I can help someone who may need it.The pictures and description on this website are accurate EXCEPT the color. I picked the green but the green I got is a dark green, not the bright color in the picture I had wanted, I had to just now hold it to the light and be sure it wasn't black. I got a 2nd pair bc I can't find what I did with them - nothing to do with the product. So looking at the 1st order geez only in August 2023 per past Orders on Amazon I happened to pick the same green but it's not the same - definitely not. I'm not exchanging them but I liked the other color - the one in the picture - much more. There is no color shown on the website that matches the color I received. I may call customer service and put it on the record, in case. So again 2 months ago I bought the same pair - green though I didn't remember - the order says the pair was $29 with a $6 off coupon for $23!!!The product now has a red tab where the buttons that you click to turn the earbuds on and off, volume, and answer the phone. There are now THREE BUTTONS vs two from before. There are two raised black buttons on the inside of each earbud and now there is one round silver button that powers the earbud. It says ""power on"" or ""power off"" when you click the silver buttons, no confusion! You can see the silver button on each earbud when you open the case. Remember, this lets you turn on only one for use vs always two. You need to ""pair"" these which is so easy, just do a Bluetooth scan. I just shook my head and bent down - no problem at all. It comes in a nice black plastic carrying case that snaps shut and each earbud individually fits in its place in shape (vs just loose inside). I bought these again bc I couldn't remember where I put them. At this price point (an unbelievable $39 then a checkmark gives ANOTHER 40% off at checkout equals just under $23!!!).The earbuds come in and MUST BE KEPT in THIS black case when not in use or when you're done using them. Without the case, you can't charge the earbuds, The black plastic case when open shows you the charge % left from 0% to 100% (I'd say it fully charges in 2 hours. I plug the container in overnight. It does NOT need recharging often and there is NO GUESSWORK.NOTE: WHEN YOU OPEN THE WHITE BOX which HOLDS THE BLACK CONTAINER WITH THE EARBUDS FITTED WITHIN, YOU NEED TO LOOK INSIDE THIS WHITE BOX FOR A SLIM WHITE PIECE OF THE BOX THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST THERE TO FILL SPACE. HOWEVER, INSIDE THAT BLANK WHITE THING ARE THE EXTRA EARBUD SIZES AND THE SHORT UBB CHARGE CORD OF ABOUT 6-8"". THE CASE IS THE CHARGING STATION INTO WHICH YOU PLUG THE SMALL SIDE OF THE USB CORD.I'm not going to do any more proofing or editing. I am not associated with these earbuds except they are great for ME. It literally took me over an hour to write this review.

If I do, as long as the connection wasn't severed for a long time and they turn off automatically, they will reconnect on their ownI do have an issue with how the volume buttons seemingly don't work half the time. But you can just adjust the volume on the device they are connected to.","Reviewed in the United States August 9, 2024",AH36NE36UE5LDFAPINTEDXWEIVOA,1,6,Color: Purple
R1CBTNLOXKJRTR,B09FLNSYDZ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Went in with expectations low, and I left feeling impressed",Amber,4,"For starters, the reason I bought these headphones was because I originally lost my Beats buds. I didn’t want to cough up $100, so here we are with a cheaper route lol. I was skeptical because I got these headphones only for $28 and I have seen a lot of mixed reviews. Anyway to my luck, I went to work the next day and I ended up finding my beats right after buying a whole new pair of buds. I still wanted to give these headphones a try, and frankly, I’m impressed and instead of returning them, I’m going to keep them and get rid of my beats! I say this because for reference I have a lot of ear piercings and on one of my ears I have a daith (an earring inside your ear ) with my beats I can only wear one bud on my left ear because it’s free - ( I can wear both of them but is uncomfortable and my beats are constantly falling out my ear regardless if I use only one or both ). However with these headphones, I can use both earbuds and THEY DON’T FALL OUT ( which is such a relief) I also tested these out at the gym and they work pretty well and they didn’t fall out despite me doing lots of movement, and adding on at full volume I didn’t hear background noise ( and my gym can get loud from hearing weights be dropped on the ground, grunting, etc ) I would say that they are just a TINY and I say that loosely because it’s not that big of a difference in my opinion with sound with these headphones compared to my Beats. The only reason it’s not a five-star is that after a while ( maybe a few hours ) my ear starts to itch a little bit from wearing them and that’s about it, to be honest. Battery life is really good. I got these on May 1st and they are already charged at full battery. I have not once charged these headphones and it has been 3 days and they are only at 81%Ps. I use my headphones for 5+ hours at a time so this is rlly good for my music lovers","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2024",AFUGBWI76KXW7IQUITONU2F6FR7Q,1,25,Color: Black

R2E4VRFGMPR8E9,B09FLNSYDZ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Works as expected, with some added perks",Kyle H,4,"I bought these when my mpow flame 2s died. I see on Amazon there are a bunch of vendors selling various reskinned mpow models, but I didn't feel like taking a chance on overpaying for an inferior model (many aren't clearly labeled because they are trying to pass off as another brand entirely, so I don't know which model is which, in regards to old mpow model labels.) I went into these headphones expecting a comparable item, hopefully a little better, but not worse.Sound quality is kind of difficult to quantity, and everyone's hearing is different, but I find these to be at roughly the same quality level as my old headphones. It lacks a little bit of the bass the flame 2s had, but the sound is a little clearer. Overall a decent lateral move.I originally wanted wired headphones specifically, because I work during the summers with one headphone in, and the other ear free. These headphones can run with just the left, or right, unit in ear, while the other one can be in the case charging. This lets me use up the battery of one while the other reacharges, which is a big plus.The range is pretty decent for this price point, I get about 40ft unobstructed or 30ft with walls and such.The pairing was an unexpected bonus. It's very quick (both pairing to one another and to my devices) and when I want to put them away I don't need to individually shut them off and put them in the case. I can just take them out of my ears and place them in the charging case, and they automatically unpair and shut down. Same goes with taking them out, I just remove them, and they automatically turn on and pair to each other and then my device.Battery life is about what's advertised and the case battery hold multiple full charges. I use them regularly and find I only need to plug them in every few days. The case shows the case battery charge remaing.There are a few negatives. While the case will show the headphones charging (with a multi led indicator light rising) it doesn't show real time capacity. So, for example, there are 3 or 4 small leds, one set for R until one for L, that will turn on when you place the headphones in the case. It will flash the bottom light then middle light and last top, but that cycle will just repeat until they are full, at which point the lights turn off. They won't illuminate halfway when at 50% ECT. So I know when they are charging and when they are full, but not by how much, which seems like an odd choice given there are multiple lights there, seemingly to do just that.Another negative is the case feels very flimsy, especially at the joint. You need to be careful opening and closing, if you need these to last.Last negative I have is how the headphones hook into my ear. I need to have them tilted upwards (with the earband pushed further down the back of my ear) to get them to stay put. It sorta looks weird, like normally these types of sport headphones have the body of the until point straight ahead, and not pointing up towards my eye level. It's not a big deal, because they stay in decently well when fixed this way, but it feels like it's not supposed to be that way, at least compared to any other Bluetooth sport headphones I've used. These buds won't fall out of ear, but if I'm vigorously moving or talking, they can sometimes lose that tight in ear seal that gives the best sound quality and blocks outside noise. For my uses they do a good enough job though, and at least they don't straight up fall out.Overall I'm pleased with my purchase. I got them on sale (at time of posting) for around $26, which I feel these headphones are worth that much and a bit more. I'd probably pay up to $30 (maybe $35 if this specific style or brand had something others didn't and I wanted) but not more than that. These are decent budget headphones. I feel it's a good buy for money asked and would buy again. I hope this review can help some people decide on what to buy. In a sea of choices and reviews it can feel daunting.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2022",AG2WIRZJTCLBUPQQHGWARZFW64HQ,1,442,Color: Black

I have a terrible time trying to get to sleep and I need to listen to something but it often bothers my SO when he's falling asleep.While I can't lay on them, I can have 1 in on the side I'm not laying on. And I can easily fall asleep wearing it!! Also, I used to use corded ear buds but we got a kitten and she thought it was all kinda fun to play with the cord while I was trying to use them.3. I admit a factor was that they're really pretty colors. 😄I didn't get them to use for phone calls but, it turns out, they're great for that, too! No one has a problem hearing me and I have no problem hearing them. The clarity is fantastic! Not just for the music and watching shows on my phone but, for calls!

It's also really sensitive to certain pitches, especially when I have a migraine. But, however these are made, they don't bother me AT ALL!The ONLY thing I can possibly say that's remotely negative is that you can only get about 12 ft from your phone before they cut out.

Unfortunately, no charging cable was included, so I attempted to access the company via the enclosed instructions. The website looks slick, but it was impossible to actually get Support on their Support page, so I emailed the company and subsequently requested a replacement through Amazon. When the new pair arrived, it seemed pretty likely that the first pair I had received had clearly been opened, used, and returned before being sent to me. Unlike the first pair, The new pair had all components and was shrink wrapped. As I reviewed the first box, it was clear that it had not been shrink wrapped as it had an Amazon LPN sticker directly on the package. If it had been shrink wrapped, the sticker would have been on the wrap—not directly on the box. Additionally, the first pair had a defective earbud—the left one cut out at least once per minute. So far, the new pair seems to be working better.

Then I upgraded to a phone without a headphone jack and decided it was time to get Bluetooth headphones. I bought this item because they came in different colors besides black and white and they were a relatively low price point. I got them in the bright blue color.I love the way they look.They do not disappoint! They connect quickly and have surprisingly great sound! They are not noise reducing, however the earpieces fit so well in my ears that it makes it hard to hear people or noises around me unless my volume is down very low or I take one earbud out of my ear.I really like the charging indicator on the front. They charge using a USB-C cord (included) OR by placing the case on a Qi charger. The cord charges them way faster, but I like having the flexibility of both means.I liked these so much I got another set in a different color for my teenage son. I figured if he broke or lost them, they're not a significant cost to replace. (Also the reason I trusted myself with them.)Of course it would be ME who left the earbuds in a pocket of shorts that I then put through the washing machine. Oops. BUT I put them immediately into a bag of rice to draw out the moisture. Impatiently, I took them out two hours later to charge and try again. They worked! The sound was muffled at first but now that it has been a few days since the sound is back to normal.I do NOT recommend washing them, nor wearing them in water, but they made it though one accidental washing.I am super impressed that these things held up so well to my carelessness, and have great sound and functionality.

R31Y2KCBASOXLW,B09LD2D1TV,5.0 out of 5 stars Great value for both phone calls and music,thirst4music,5,"Sometimes I'm amazed by the advancements in wireless and micro technology, especially when it comes to audio. These popped up in an email from Amazon a few days ago. Though I usually ignore those Deal notices this one intrigued me. I have a JBL Everest over-ear headset that I love for indoor phone calls and they're pretty good for music too (though I don't use them that way). I often like to go outside when I'm on the phone and the JBLs aren't convenient to use with a stocking cap, so I'd thought briefly about getting something in-ear to wear under my hat. These were $35 and the reviews were good. I liked that the case wirelessly charges the ear buds, and the case can be charged wirelessly too. My Samsung phone has wireless charging so I already have two wireless chargers and they're very convenient (especially given that the USB port on my phone was getting sketchy). So I figured I'd give them a try. I played a variety of my favorite music. I first asked for Jeff Buckley live music and the first song that started playing as I stepped outside was ""Hallelujah."" I walked around the property listening to my favorite music and before I knew it I had been listening to music for about three hours. I had really only cared about the sound quality for phone calls and whether they would stay in my ears (which is usually a problem for me). They never came close to falling out and they are comfortable. For phone calls the sound quality is very good on both ends. And though they're rated as having a 33' range I walked all around the house and got considerably farther than that from my phone with two walls separating the devices and I had no dropouts. Overall I am so happy with them that after a week of using them I ordered a backup pair.I have three VERY minor niggles but even combined I wouldn't consider them significant enough to knock off even ½ star. First, I had trouble gripping them well enough to get them out of the case quickly when I got an unexpected phone call. I started leaving them on a paper towel on the table next to me, but it now seems I've discovered the right way to grip them. Second, though they have a voice announcement of which side is which when first removed from the case, I was concerned that I might confuse L and R as they don't appear to have any visible indicators. My solution was to use my fine-point permanent marker to write an L on the left one. Third, one of my wireless phone chargers is a tilted stand that holds my phone at a convenient angle. I was unable to get the Ear buds case to wirelessly charge on that one until last night when I accidentally discovered that the problem was that the case was too small to hit the sweet spot on the charger. I solved the problem by boosting the case up with a pad of mini sticky notes (as shown in the photo).EDIT (I apologize if I forget to come back to delete my previous review):None of the above has changed but I forgot to mention that these are NOT good for noise isolation (at least not the way they fit me) but I prefer it that way. I'm a musician and music sounds less natural to me when the surrounding environment is completely eliminated, and I like being able to have a conversation or hear a knock at the door without removing them. Even without a tight seal I never have to reseat them and the sound quality stays consistent (a first for me after trying several other brands).UPDATE: I've been using these ear buds for five weeks now. I use them for hours every day and they continue to impress me. On three occasions only the right channel had a signal when I initially put them in to listen to music, but each time I put them back in the case and took them out again (which turned them off and on) and they worked normally. I've only had this happen with music and only when I first take them out of the case (i.e. it hasn't happened while on a call or after I've been listening to music with both working).","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2023",AEIAPKZ2ZRKFIS5YI3PZY6QAHOVA,1,947,Size: MColor: Black

And ironically, it usually has to do with ear buds. There are tons of them on the market, and everyone claims to be the best.Now, first off, I am just a customer… never got any gifts or money or anything from this company, nor was asked to “click on a review” for a discount or whatever. No… the reason for all this hallelujah chorus, is that I’m really totally both jazzed, and a bit in awe of these earbuds. I think the main mind-blowing thing about them is the price. I mean, I have a bit of experience and knowledge with this kind of technology, and frankly, these days, what “guts” that are needed to be used to create Bluetooth ear buds is not that complex… nor expensive. How company’s like Sony, Apple, Bose, etc. can charge upwards of $300 for these boarders on theft and fraud!I’ve tried those “Rolls Royce” buds, and I urge you to do the same, and then try these Tagry Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds that are literally 90% less expensive. Yes, they retail for about $35! They come in an excellent quality charge base, are extremely easy to put on, (and have three extra size buds to give you a custom fit), and most important, their sound quality, and I mean crisp highs, solid middles, and bone- rumbling base, are outstanding. I cannot understand what more you would want either using them for talk radio, podcasts, YouTube, streaming movies, or TV, or playing your Amazon Music or Spotify or iTunes playlists. And yes, if connected to your iPhone, you can make and receive calls, and the microphone in the buds are top quality.Their Bluetooth software is flawless, connecting to your iPhone, or other Bluetooth devices effortlessly. They come with a pleasant woman’s voice letting you know various messages, like which earbud is in what ear, if they are connected or turned off, your volume control (including excess volume warning), etc.I’ve had these for several months, and have found the charging, which has a bright LED display and shows the individual charging of each bud, along with their percentage easy to read.And a note on their service. I’ve heard horror stories of folks trying to reach the outrageously over-priced other earbud company’s for tech support, or refunds, exchanges, etc. Basically it’s nonexistent, and when you do miraculously find a phone number to call them, and get someone on the line, you have to go to the UN to find an interpreter of rare third-world languages to understand what they are saying, and they seem to be trained, not on anything to do with the product, but to make the call as useless and confusing as possible, so that you will just give up and throw their buds, and your money in the trash.Now, I did have an initial problem, after a few months, in that the base charger seemed to be slowing a bit. Tagry gives you a LIFETIME WARRANTY… yes, an actually lifetime warranty, not one of those sham “lifetime warranties”, that corrupt company’s like Hammacher Schlemmer have.I had enrolled with Tagry, on their website, to activate my warranty as soon as I received the buds. I called Tagry when I was seeing what could be a glitch in their charging base, and yes, unlike most other companies who hide their contact numbers as if they were nuclear codes, Tagry’s support phone number is plainly printed on their manual, and to my astonishment, I immediately was connected to a good ‘ol American customer service person, who actually worked for the company, spoke English, and made me feel as if I was a long-ago trusted friend. They truly cared, and said they were sorry, and that there was no need to troubleshoot the base, or return it, instead, they would process an order to send me a new one.A day later, they actually called me back to let me know that the replacement had been shipped, and that I should have it in a day or so, and if not, to please call them back right away. And yes, to apologize again for any inconvenience. The replacement arrived the very next day. And again, their warranty is indeed for a lifetime, a no questions asked replacement policy. This is how much they believe in their product, and respect their customers.So, yes. It is insane to pay more than $35 for quality Bluetooth earbuds. Last year, I sent about a dozen of these out to friends and employees, to use for personal use, and for all that Zooming going on… and they love them. And none of had any problems.I’m sure you have had a plethora of bad experiences in the past few years, what with isolation, and way too much ordering on-line, finding the products you buy to be substandard, and customer service virtually non-existent. And that is why I’ve spend all this time expounding on the greatest of my earbuds. Yes, I have a life. Really. But what a joy to be able to tell a story like this, rather than the kind of frustration most of us are experiencing every day!Yes, goodness and quality still exist. It’s rare… but it’s out there!","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2023",AFTIKTZNNLVXB2TFELWQJURQWC6A,1,2223,Size: MColor: Purple
R147UXYW9SWRRU,B09LD2D1TV,3.0 out of 5 stars Just ok,Becky,3,"Purchased these to replace my older pair of Jaybird earbuds. They always connect to my phone easily and I love that there’s no additional app to download to use them. My biggest issue is when I try to use them to talk on the phone. People tell me that the audio alternates between louder and softer and makes it incredibly difficult to hear or understand me. Most describe the audio as “it sounds weird.” I can hear them fine, it's just them hearing me. After the first month, they basically do not function at all for phone calls anymore. I can no longer answer a call with them and when I use my phone to answer, I can’t get the call to play through them (even if I was listening to music through them and try to pick up a call). I am resigned to using them only as earbuds and not to make/receive calls through. They are comfortable and stay well on my ears though, which is why I didn’t rate them lower.Pro: no app to download, work well for music or podcasts, fit nicely and don’t fall out, good price point.Con: audio on calls is terrible and they quickly stop functioning for calls at all.","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2024",AGANYVAPAOIE37FSBHDQQLMNUW3Q,1,1,Size: MColor: Purple
R2WFG0LP07A8S2,B09LD2D1TV,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible Customer Service,J. Jones,5,"I have purchased several pairs of these and have been very happy with their performance. Plenty of people have talked about how well these work and sound though. I wanted take a minute to applaud their customer service. I have honestly never experienced such amazing customer service.One of my pair of earbuds I have had for two years had a malfunction on the right earbud. It would not turn on after removing from the case and connecting to bluetooth. It was very frustrating. I tried any number of things to make it reconnect. It occasionally would, but just for that one time and only after monkeying with it for many annoying minutes.I was about to throw them away, but I saw in the original case the warranty information and decided to give it a try. I used their website to register the issue. I was blown away when customer service contacted me within 24 hours. They asked for some basic information and then emailed me back with a procedure to try to reset the headphones. I tried, but no luck. I was already impressed they had reached out so quickly.Now this part amazes me. I was super busy at the time, and so I didn't email them back right away. So three days later, they reached out to ME! I have never had customer service follow up like that. I apologized for the delay and told them that the procedure didn't work. That was it. They told me they'd ship me out a replacement pair within the next couple days! Fast forward, and less than a week later I received my replacements in the mail. Wow.I am so thankful. Customer service was professional, courteous, and insanely fast. Again, the best I've ever encountered on any product that I own.If you are in the market for earbuds, definitely consider these. You can take confidence that your purchase is backed up by a company that takes supporting their products seriously.","Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2024",AEB2V33GEHHD5IG7B2HDRMM5S5XQ,1,1,Size: MColor: Black
R6ABNA6DRUVWV,B09LD2D1TV,"5.0 out of 5 stars Yes, they stay out while running.",Rodney,5,"I have been hesitant for years to buy earbuds because I just ""knew"" they would fall out while running. I went out of my way to buy everything except earbuds. I bought every kind of audio device that wraps around every part of the ear, neck, and head all because I just ""knew"" earbuds would fall out...I won't bore you with the whole story. Honestly , I think it comes down to me being older and a little stubborn to try something new. If you're like me (stubborn), stop doing that. These things work great. They're easy to use, and they won't fall out.If you're like me and curious about why or how they won't fall out, get ready for the nerdy part of this review. I was stubborn about buying them because I didn't understand how they could stay out with wrapping around something, but here's is how they work:It's in the design. The stay put because they wedge themselves in the intertragul notch of your ear, between the antitragus and the tragus. In other words, they use the natural shape of your ears' cartilage to hold them in place. It's pretty brilliant.

They were in there for over 10 minutes before I even realized I left them in there. When I took them out they were drenched in water. However it's about 20 minutes after that and they are fine case is now dried, and both earbuds still charges perfectly fine as well as the case.

Tagry earbuds against my cousin's ~$275. Bose pair. He was dismayed to find that he couldn't discern a difference between them.For the most part, the observable features were identical. His claimed noise cancellation, but I barely noticed that when listening to music at a moderate volume.My only criticism (and this applies to most earbud types) is that the electrostatic conductive volume control is imprecise. I would much prefer a far more accurate push button volume control. These days, even the $300 Bose maintain that unfortunate feature.Overall, my new Tagrys are as good as -- and probably a little better -- than my old ones, and I'm still using the first set I purchased ~4 yrs ago.I never hesitate to recommend Tagry earbuds to my friends and family.

I don't normally write reviews, but after night I put my earbud through, it definitely deserves it. I was listening to Harry potter for the 1067th time with it while brushing my teeth. We live in a super run down house, so the sink drain doesn't have a stopper. And what happens? Of course, it's what I've imagined happening every single time I lean over that sink. (No, not pennywise speaking to me through the drains, although I have had that thought too.) My left earbud popped out of my ear and went straight down the drain.There was water down the pipe (which I guess is supposed to be there all the time. Who knew.) So I tried fishing it out with a coat hanger. That didn't work. Then I watched three youtube videos about how to remove the p-trap (that's that one pipe that is kinda u shaped under your sinks) because I was just hoping beyond hope that it would still be there. But you see, I already struggle opening a jar of pickles, so yeah there was very little hope for me to unscrew that p-trap.Now, this was at 11pm and my man was already asleep. So i wrote a quick and desperate plea along with a declaration of love and a few bribes for him to see once he woke up in the morning. At that point I did not think it would work. I just didn't want it blocking the pipes and breaking my already broken house.But what do I awaken to? My man presenting me with an earbud. I returned it to the charger, probably out of habit more than anything and saw that it was charging. Weird. Then a few hours later, curious, I put the ear bud in and what happens? It works.

These earbuds come with very smart touch control, providing effective and sensitive responses, thanks to the high quality built-in MIC. The true wireless range of 33 feet is genuine and I have tested it in various conditions with perfect results every time.One of the standout features for me has been the battery life, which lasts for many hours on a single charge, exceeding my expectations for earbuds in this price range. Speaking of price, it's surprisingly low given the high quality of the product. This makes the Tagry X08 not just a purchase, but a steal!Additionally, I want to highlight the exceptional customer support provided by Tagry. They were prompt, courteous, and very helpful with my inquiries. This level of service makes the buying experience even more satisfying.I'm so convinced by the quality and value of these earbuds that I've vowed to never switch to another brand again. I've already recommended the Tagry X08 to many friends, and if you're in the market for reliable, high-quality earbuds that won't break the bank, look no further.

The RH is on its last leg and cracks a lot.I decanted to try these and they work awesome so far. I can't really say how long the batteries last because I haven't seen under 96% yet. The volume goes twice as high as the apple. Again I'm not sure if it's because it's half blown or not. I would give these an A to A+ so far.They connect very quickly. Overall, I would so far buy these over again because of the price and save the money compared to what Apple has out. No need to cry if one gets lost or accidentally broken.That is a huge plus.**Update**. I have used these now for a week and I love them. I left my phone in the garage and closed the door. Walked all the way down to the chicken barn which is roughly 200 feet before they started cutting out. I finally lost signal when I walked into the barn. The battery life is exactly what they say. I have never once had to charged the base itself yet.**Update**. 5/16. Had a small issue today. For some reason as soon as I put them in my ears they kept repeating ""volume max"". I would manual turn the volume down on my phone and suddenly the volume would just start go back up by itself. I had to disconnect bluetooth, throw them in the case, and then reconnect. Then it stopped. Battery and sound is still impressive though. Hopefully that problem doesn't keep happening.**Update**. 5/26. Battery life is still great. Sounds is still amazing. I did have another issue today on a call. I don't use them much for talking but somebody just now said I was echoing like crazy. I finally had to just throw them on speaker phone. I have talked before on these a nobody has said anything until this company. Jury is still out of it was my side or his.***Update*** 8/4. I would buy these again but they are developing ghost issues that I haven't looked up yet. For the price it's not really worth it. Sound and battery life is still amazing. My two issues are the range and volume. Sometimes they go a long distance and other times they disconnect in the 30 foot range. Volume issues - they will randomly just take off and start climbing with no control. I use the phone to turn it back down but you watch the phone just go up and up on its own. That is the worst ghost issue. I have to disconnect and reconnect and then it stops.","Reviewed in the United States May 3, 2023",AE2LJIOUSTG4IOL33TUDESMAAAPA,1,48,Size: MColor: White

However, I did find the initial setup and pairing to be a bit cumbersome. The LED power display on the case is incredibly convenient, clearly showing the battery level for both the case and the earbuds. The wireless charging feature and IPX5 waterproof rating make these earbuds perfect for any activity, whether I’m working out or just commuting to work.One standout aspect is their lightweight and ergonomic design, which ensures a comfortable fit. With three different sizes of ear tips, they fit snugly without causing discomfort, even during extended use. The sound quality is quite impressive for the price point, delivering a well-balanced audio experience with clear mids and solid bass. However, the noise isolation could be better, as I find myself needing to increase the volume in noisier environments.Despite the minor issues, like the case's strong magnets making it a bit tricky to remove the earbuds quickly, I’m quite pleased with my purchase. The easy touch controls and the hall switch feature for one-step pairing are user-friendly. These earbuds offer excellent value for their price, making them a great choice for anyone in need of reliable, budget-friendly wireless earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2024",AFBPBAVFDXQBL25KG3KK4IAPR65A,1,30,Size: MColor: Purple

R1D42JQRVV1XW6,B09LD2D1TV,5.0 out of 5 stars Buy the earbuds! You won't regret it.,PR,5,"These earbuds are freaking fantastic! I bought them becuase they have such good reviews and for a change of pace, the reviews were true.I had been using another bluetooth earpiece for a long time, one that hooked behind my ear. While it was okay for short term calls, anything that lasted more than 15-20 minutes was painful because the ear 'hook' caused my ear to hurt quite a bit. I use my bluetooth ear piece to listen to music while I cycle, so the pain was a major problem. Every wireless earbuds I tried came out of my ears the minute I put on my cycling helmet, so I put up with my 'hooked' earpiece, just because it was better than riding without music.The blessing was that I had to upgrade my phone and my new phone wouldn't pair with my old bluetooth earpiece. I bought the TAGRY True Wireless Earbuds hoping that things would get better but not really believing the reviews.The good news:1. You can wear both earbuds or just one. It isn't safe to cycle with both earbuds in because you can't really hear surrounding traffic. Not only was I able to listen to music with just one earbud, I was able to take a call and continue riding. The wind noise made it difficult to hear me, but I was riding into the wind at close to 15mph, so I'm not going to mark them down for that. I could hear my caller just fine, and if I slowed down, they were able to hear me well enough to answer my questions.2. The sound quality is fantastic, and when both earbuds are in, you really can just relax and listen to whatever without being disturbed by outside noises. They are not entirely noise cancelling, so if you don't have the volume way up, you can still hear the captain telling you the seat belt sign has been turned on due to turbulence.3. They are so, so, SO comfortable. The inside of my ear doesn't hurt, and since there is no annoying hook behind my ear, I wore my earbud for 40 minutes without any pain. I came home from my ride 20 minutes ago and I'm still listening to music as I write this review. My ear doesn't hurt at all, which is a huge relief.4. They are secure in your ear! My ride this morning was plenty bumpy with the occasional jump off a curb and that earbud didn't even move. My helmet was not holding it in or even touching the earbud, and yet it didn't move at all. I don't feel like I have to jam the earbud into my ear to keep it secure. I am a relatively small person, and I usually struggle to find earbuds that are not too large and changing the silicone earpiece doesn't help as much as you would think.5. The price is so low for the quality that you get. I cannot believe how inexpensive these earbuds are. Buy yourself a pair, then buy a pair for your friends and for your kids. These earbuds are totally worth it. I am buying two more pairs as gifts to give to friends because are so amazing.6. The charging case. I carry these in my purse and the case is nice and small…and the case keeps the earbuds charged for quite a while. I put these in my purse just before taking off for a 4 day weekend last week and I still haven’t had to recharge the case even though it’s been over a week and I’ve used them every day.Don’t think about it…just buy the earbuds.

Plus i don’t have to click a button, I can just tap them which feels better for some reason. They’re pretty good quality for the price. And I like how small they are. The size is real nice, it’s not to big to fit in your ear but not to small to fall out. They’re pretty comfortable, better if not the same as my skullcandys. And while the mic seems to be about the same as my skullcandys, that doesn’t mean it’s bad. It’s still really good for wireless earbuds. They’re cheaper and honestly a little better so I would recommend these any day of the week. My only complaint really is how easy it is to adjust the volume but tapping the earbuds. If I try to push the earbud into my ear cause it starts falling out a bit, it turns it up and I can’t tell you how many times I accidentally turn it up while laying down.

R3UK6JSSN2LFZ2,B09HN4DHFL,4.0 out of 5 stars Good inexpensive earbuds.,nekoBasu,4,"I recommend these as an inexpensive earbud set.I like that they're red, so that stand out on my messy desk.I needed a new set to of earbuds, and decided Apple wasn't getting any more of my money in this space. I'm not thrilled with the longevity or support apple provides for their airpods pro.I found these on a list of of good cheap earbuds, and I'm happy. They work fine at the gym. out of the box, with the default rubber ear tips, I ran a mile on the treadmill this morning and I didn't fiddle with these once (for fit). They stay right where they're supposed to, which is not something I can say for airpods pro or another pair of earbuds I'd been using at the gym.These are not audiophile grade headphones. if you want that, keep looking. They do isolate pretty well. The base on the bass boost eq setting is just ok. But the sound is balance enough that it's not overly ""tinny"". I hate cheap speakers, and these don't sound too cheap. So while it's not the finest sound ever, it's still far from junk.Technically, coming from airpods, there are two downsides I've noticed (both survivable).1 - with my fingers - the buds themselves are very hard to remove from the charging case. If I never had owned airpods, I'm not sure I would know this. on the other hand, I think they seat really nicely in the case, and thus they always charge. The airpods famously don't always connect inside their case and sometimes aren't charging when you think they are. I'm ok with it, and I assume I'll eventually learn the ""trick"" to pulling these guys out with ease.2 - these were very easy to pair to my iphone. HOWEVER, unlike airpods, once these are paired to a device, they CANNOT be paired to another device unless they bluetooth connection is disconnected from the first device. e.g. with airpods, you can go back and forth between a macbook, an iphone, and an ipad, simply by selecting the airpods from the device. With these, if I was using them with my iphone, and then I want to use them with my ipad, I need to turn bluetooth off on the iphone for a moment until the buds are ""free"", and then I can connect them to my ipad. Sub-optimal, but not a deal breaker for me./a few pluses.1 - I can side-sleep with these in and they don't hurt. yay.2 - I love that the usb charging plug is integrated into the case. last thing I need is more cables.3 - again, for me, they fit well. Snug, almost to the point of being too big, but they don't bother me. I'm really impressed that they just stay put while I'm running and I don't need to constantly push them back into my ears for fear that they'll fall out./I haven't really had these long enough to have an opinion on the battery life.I haven't tried using these for calls yet, so no opinion on the microphone.","Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2024",AGILVFT4SJ2DBC5KKWH6WSVY6LGQ,1,148,Color: RoseStyle: Pop

R3UWOH4RB5J595,B09HN4DHFL,5.0 out of 5 stars UPDATE: First Impressions,MayBae,5,"UPDATE:My AirPods are dying and have been constantly dropping Bluetooth with my phone, so I borrowed these from my daughter to wear for the day. I have had the right bud in for 7.5 hours and the battery percentage (which actually does show up on my phone screen in the control center) shows that I still have 40% battery life left. I also have not dropped Bluetooth once (!) and they still feel comfortable and light in my ear. I’m pretty astounded, actually. My AirPods would have died hours ago. The only issue I had was when I received a phone call. My phone rang, as well as hearing the ringing through the earbud, but when I answered, it did not automatically connect to the earbud at all. I had to talk into the phone normally. I also have noticed a distinct difference in the bass level between these and the AirPods. I don’t know how much of it has been the slow death of the AirPods, but these sound so much better than the first time I tried them. 10/10. Do it.Old Review:I heard these were a pretty decent earbud set for the price and decided to try them out as a backup set. I’m coming from AirPod Pro (1st Generation) and prior to that, the Jabra 75t.I have to admit, this isn’t bad for a $25 set of earbuds. One of the reasons I switched from the Jabra 75t’s (aside from the fact I had to get warranty replacements TWICE), was because I wanted to be able to use each earbud interchangeably and Jabra did not have that at the time. I’m actually quite surprised that JLab included the functionality for this price point. The charger being built into the bottom of the case was a nice touch and I appreciate that both earbuds go in the case magnetically, as well as the lid being magnetic as well. It paired easily with my iPhone 15 Pro and my daughter’s iPad.These are definitely lighter than both my Jabras and Pros. They fit in the ear nicely and I could see myself being able to wear them for a while (doing most things) and not have them fall out. My ears must be different sizes because my Pros consistently fall out of my left ear, but stay pretty good in my right ear.There isn’t an app for these, so while you can change songs, adjust volume, and use Siri by pressing the buttons on the earbuds, you won’t be able to tweak any part of the sound. You also will not be able to check the battery percentage and will have to go off the audio prompts it gives you. These also do not have noise-cancelling capabilities (which I honestly wouldn’t expect at the low price).So, here’s where I’m taking off one star…the sound. I’m not an audiophile. I don’t typically listen to music so the majority of my use is podcasts, audiobooks, or YT/Twitch vids. The sound is a bit muted (…not an audiophile) and not quite as clear as my Pros. For that reason, I likely will not use them unless I need to charge both my Pro earbuds at the same time…and both my Jabra’s are dead, haha. They would be fine in a pinch, but not something I would choose if my Pros are available.I also cannot speak to the battery life as I haven’t used them for more than a couple minutes, but what they promise (32 hours) is extremely impressive. I ended up giving them to my daughter to use as she only has over the ear headphones. I will say it’s a great first set of earbuds for kids as you do get a lot of great features in a lower priced set.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2024",AFM6HO7FF4655PMXN7TUUKEIJ6UQ,1,17,Color: LilacStyle: Pop

I figured the next pair of ear buds I get better be cheap in case I do this again. Luckily, I seem to have learned my lesson and these have been spared the wrath of the washing machine. The sound quality is very similar to the raycons I used to have with similar features, but these earbuds are way cheaper. The small ear pieces seem to be a tad bit too small (though they only fall out occasionally) while the medium seems to be too big for my ears but the custom tips are still nice to have nonetheless. I really like that the charger cord is attached to the case itself. Really neat feature. The battery lasts a decent bit too.

The left bud is a-ok. Really this didn't last (note: i did get these used-like new and i have used them a bit) as long as I'd hope but it doesn't change my opinion. For the price (say $19.99) you can do better .. even if you have to wait for say a lightning deal on something like the TOZO T6's for $22.99 or something ... BUT ... i'd not say ""these are horrible, avoid"" ... the sound isn't the best like i said but they are small and really comfortable ... and while they dont have the best sound ... i have heard FAR worse ... just a little EQ'ing and these sound decent for relaxing music (one of my main uses) .. for podcasts or something ... that doesn't matter as much anyway (EQ'ing them) .... I will update this if i find its an easy fix but even a few resets hasn't gotten the right but to turn on yet.April 2023 Update: well ... I see these are $23 now ... I dont think they are worth that much (just a few $1's too high, dont get me wrong) ... but I got mine used-like new for $12.50 and I have seen them say at the $16 or so range ... you know .. these aren't 'great"" but they are not that bad. I think say for podcasts or whatever they are fine ... you can just find better for music (even ""jlab signature"" and eq'ed on top). having said that ... I have used these at night for sleeping and they fit great. I HAVE gotten use to being careful with the built in cable (still not a fan of that though ... if a cable breaks you can replace it... if this breaks, your charging case cant charge the earbuds).I hate to act like any of the buds I still have are ""not comfortable"" but for me, comfort wise, these are up there. As long as you dont expect these to be top quality buds (NOR worst of the low price buds, again dont get me wrong) .. I think people may like theseUpdate 2+ condensed) After using these for a bit, and even counting the best EQ option (Jlab Signature) and a v-shaped EQ on top via Wavelet (app) these still do not sound as good as some other pairs i have, however using them for side sleep (whatever side faces the pillow DOESN'T have an earbud in), these do a surprising good job at passive noise cancelling for me. While they also dont sound the best... they dont sound ""bad"" either ... you can some real no-name duds below $20, .. these are decent for that sub $20 price range to be clear.I gave these 3 out of 5 stars but really its maybe between a 3.5 TO MAYBE a 3.75 to be clear ... maybe more toward 3.5 in my book though. I'd say look at TOZO first for deals ... but I still recommend these.They are comfortable to me too ... like they dont feel too big ... just right.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 1) I did notice one day when it was REALLY humid the controls seem to get wonky ... like sometimes my presses weren't ""registering"" and then others would which would mean i'd do a function (change track for instance) when i wanted to change the EQ mode instead... it doesn't alway happen but it has once or twice in constant use since i bought these.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------i have to say the default tips + the size of the buds combo are nice ... I have ( .. even just to test THESE) been using these sleeping at times rather than my TOZO T6's and while i love the T6's i haven't found the ""perfect"" eartips for them that fit me (so to speak) ... at times with these Go Air Pops ... I hardly notice they are in my ears ... I didn't even open the little bag with the other tips to make sure (note: bought ""used - like new"") I got the other tips, yetmy one con that I REMEMBER typing this update is the sound quality ... .ok for the price on ""JLab Signature"" EQ but bang for your buck ... counting deals on Amazon ... you may be able to do better.So far Battery Life seems decent enough ... a little shorter than I expected but like i said i am using these for sleep and i count that time that I am sleeping so .... yeah battery life is good for the price, I'd say--------------------------First I want to mention this is all based on my first impressions after a few hours of use, only … things may change later. Bluetooth Earbuds I have are TOZO’s T6’s and NC2’s (two pair now), Fiil’s T1XS with app support, and Edifier’s TWS1 Pros and Earfun wise the Air Free Pro 2’s, (Returned due to a number of issues) Earfun Free Mini’s and to be clear… Earfun Free’s that were sent to me unexpectedly after they saw my review of the Free Mini’s (thank you Earfun) … point being is that I have experience with a number of earbuds even if I do use some more than the others (no real particular reason).Right away I noticed these opinionsPros- Fit – to be clear none of the buds I have are really “uncomfortable” in any way but these just fit good, with the default tips … or what I am guessing is the default tips (comparing them to the default TOZO T6 tips, they seem the same size) …. Unless my ear starts to itch or something, I HARDLY notice the Go Air Pops are in my ears. I love my TOZO T6’s (form factor wise the nearest on the list I mentioned, to the same form factor as these)… but these just seem to fit a little better.Update a few days later (after writing the prior paragraph) – these while they have fallen out from time to time… these are very comfortable. When using them for sleep (whatever side of my head faces the pillow if “side sleeping” doesn’t have an earbud in) … they are more comfortable then the TOZO T6’s I have used for the same thing before and with these there are times I barely know they are there, and I really like that.- Build quality – I will not say these have “great” build quality .. that just seems to be overstating it but these do not feel as cheap as the Earfun Air Free Mini’s. Some ultra budget earbuds have a quality where it just feels like the cheapest plastics and materials were used … not the case with these buds, even if they don’t scream ‘high end quality” either.- Battery Life – I am not going to act like I have counted or even really paid attention but these seem to last awhile and even after falling asleep for a bit with these… I cant say I have ever woken up to them NOT playing … since I bought them I had to charge them once and (just in case, I probably didn’t have to) then a second time, just to make sure the case was fully charged at that point, but I just had no idea the case’s charge then and it could have been say 70% or something and the second charge was un-needed.I’d say I am “impressed” by the battery life being good.------------------------------Pros/Con (??) – This may be my least favorite sounding earbud I have but … from what I remember of the Earfun Free Mini’s … they do sound better than they did … and I love TOZO but I can not compare these with the TOZO A1’s which I don’t have …. say comparing these to the TOZO T6’s seems sort of unfair as the A1’s (TOZO brand wise) are more of the equivalent to the Go Air Pops. They could sound the same for all I know.I do notice a difference using the built in EQ’s (note too that no matter the headphone or earbud I tend to have an EQ setting or app with a “U” to a “V” setting applied) … but not much … I do agree that the Bass Boost mode CAN muddy things up at times … the Flat EQ setting …. makes it a lot flatter sounding (no matter what I listened to) than I was expecting … I mean FLAT sounding … NOT “neutral” like I’d describe the TOZO T6’s for example.The best setting between the three is Jlab’s Signature sound which boosts the Bass and the Treble in a V like sound signature. Like the Fiil T1XS’s many EQ options and customization, for instance are nice to have, in my view … the default sort of “V” signature THEY offer is also the best THEY sound. If I am not mistaken .. the “Jlab signature” sound EQ setting IS the default and it does sound the best, like I said.After a few days and a “side-by-side” comparison to the TOZO T6’s I have (some of the others are in a higher price bracket … I am trying to be fair here) the T6’s do sound “sharper” and “crisper” …. sort of hard to describe if you don’t get what I am saying … however, forgetting these I got “used-Like new” for $12.50 … I’d sort of say they are worth $19.99 (typical price) … but I’d HONESTLY spend a tad more for the T6’s ….if someone did ask me about these “go air pops” ...”yes or no, at 19.99?… no commentary” … I’d say yes … if you note the con’s (below)----------------------------------------------------------------Cons- The built in charging cable. - I do have to admit I KNEW about this before hand and this was not a surprise …..A) the length … I mean many earbud’s cable that comes included IS short, but this seems extra short. I may pickup usb “extension cable” to use with these buds which ACTUALLY may solve the other issue …. anyway I just do not like how short this is, where depending on how you are ABLE to charge this, the case has to be dangling somewhere with all the weight of the buds and the case on the built in cable. To keep it as a built in cable I know they HAVE TO make it small or double/triple the size of the case itself … that makes sense to me … but I’d just rather have a say separate USB-C port + cable for instanceB) I didn’t even think of this at first but with the prior Jlab model that didn’t have a top on the case (not sure who’d like that design idea) … but the built in charging cable the way Jlab has it, has the bottom (even when it’s tucked into the case) pins exposed… .this seems like a really bad idea for dust/dirt/etc to me but for the record I have only just gotten these and NOT had issues with this yet … just something that seems like an oversight or something.- Max Volume - this may or may not always be an issue but especially if you have audio that is not normalized (the default level of the source audio is too low vs what it should be) ... the max volume of these earbuds may not help.I never truly paid attention to reviews saying how loud certain buds are, but I do notice that compared to some earbuds, the MAX volume of these or even ""on tick down"" from max is what i have it on a bit (note: sometimes i do have a black Honeywell fan on next to me) .... when some other buds ... say oh 70% to max (guessing, but it's close) is good for me volume wise. Again this is not always an issue with good source audio or if your not in a loud/noisy place-----------------------------------------Summary (again based on first impressions)I think if you count lightning deals there may be better options when others go on good sales, but these aren’t bad. I can “deal with” the sound not being the greatest, but that charging cable A) being so short and B) the pins being completely exposed I do not like and maybe a deal breaker for some.I can’t say I 100% recommend (I mean counting deals there are better options out there .. even for a LITTLE BIT more in price)… nor can I say I don’t recommend (even with issues like I said) … they aren’t bad … as a backup pair or if you are just curious about theses … I’d say go ahead and give them a shot.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2022",AHSKKWKFQ2CEAY2OXB7YBOKFD2KA,1,289,Color: BlackStyle: Pop
R2Q5P2U8OJC6Z1,B09HN4DHFL,5.0 out of 5 stars So adorable and almost perfect,Leon,5,"I so wish these were the mini size!I got these first and loved them, but they were juuust not quite right. They fit amazing and I would have kept them if they didn't make the mini size. They stick out a tiny bit more than what I wanted out my ear so I'm returning them, but these are amazing earbuds.Super cute and great sound. I was really shocked by how good they sounded compared to some of the other $100+ earbuds I have tried that hurt my ears and would fall out every few seconds. I currently have a set of FIIL earbuds and they are great but they stick out your ears so far and are pretty bulky so they tend to move with too much motions, but these wouldn't budge at all. Again I only returned them because the mini size fit better with what I wanted but if they had this style in mini it would have been amazing because I love the my little pony colors they chose. It's not anywhere near the hot pink of the mini which is more red.Only thing I didn't get to try out was the mic, but I was using this strictly for music so it wouldn't have mattered.

R1Y33AFMMLBEV0,B09HN4DHFL,"4.0 out of 5 stars For $25 they're pretty decent, but there could be room for improvement.",Nightweeb92,4,"I've mostly ever bought Skullcandy headphones as they were generally my ""go to"", I went through about four of their sets before getting fed up with their odd spec listings at certain prices and annoying customer service and warranty.I needed something decent but cheap. The go air pop ended up being a popular choice so I picked them up. Generally I mainly use them for commutes and mowing the lawn (my ears start ringing after long periods of time with a lawnmower so I listen to music to avoid it).The price is great, getting these on sale is even better. They're super light weight and the fit is perfect and they stay in my ears pretty well if I'm not doing extenuous activities that make me sweat, otherwise I'm often pushing them back in, but I do sometimes have a small hassle getting them out of my ears and sometimes the case itself too. They fit in my ear a little too well that I sometimes have to get a good pinch grip to get them put, sometimes it feels like I'm not even wearing them.The build is about as expected, made with a higher grade plastic, they don't particularly feel expensive but they don't feel like dollar store cheap either, they look pretty decent ..though for the case I do wish there were a few changes. For one being the USB cable, instead of having a proprietary cable, they should just have a USB-C charging port instead. Additionally, it would've been nice to get maybe another 1 or 2 LED battery indicators in the front instead of the single one to let users know how much battery life is left in the case.On the inside they should add a recessed section to make it easier to pull the buds out of the case, I sometimes don't have good grip and the buds feel slippery, so I feel like I need to twist the buds to get them out. As for the flip top, they could make the recessed lip a little deeper, the case itself is decent but it's a little too slim that you sometimes fumble with keeping It open to get the buds out, it's sometimes just as slippery as the buds.The touch controls are pretty straight forward and easy to get used to.Sound is good ..if you're mostly into bass heavy stuff, they have a bit of clarity and some detail, but they're not something an audiophile would approve, they're just good general consumer quality. The original go air pop don't have an app so the only customizing users are limited to are the three built-in EQ settings, jlab signature/balance and bass boost.The Jlab signature sound is balanced with a slight bump in bass and treble, they're recommended as a universal sound that sounds good with just about anything. But to me it lacks clarity as some frequencies sometimes tend to mask or overpower other frequencies causing a loss in details.Balanced, is basically a flat meant for things like listening to audiobooks and podcasts, there's more focus and emphasis on boosting vocals while everything else remains relatively flat.Bass boost, is more for people who want more bass ..on top of what already feels like a more than enough bass sound from the Jlab signature sound. It's more meant for working out, but it does have a tendency to overpower the mids and highs most of the time and is the least detailed.Overall sound is good, stick with the Jlab signature sound and that's all you should really need. What the regular go air pop lacks is an EQ to help bring in more details. The Go pop+ is the same model but with a USB-C cable attached and allows connection to the Jlab app for custom EQ.One small gripe I have in color is that they don't have a mint color available for this set (or maybe not yet).And my other small gripe is this only support SBC audio encoding and not AAC which is a step up in audio quality. Yes that means the Go pop+ too only supports SBC. At this price I can't expect this to have something like LDAC support, but the inclusion of AAC would've been nice.Despite my gripes and nit-picks, for the price these are pretty decent and I'd recommend them if you're looking for something decent but cheap, I personally recommend going with the updated Go pop+ as they're the same as the go air pop but with app support and USB-C.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AHBH456GHSTRY32NAQBKZU6SJY5A,1,7,Color: SlateStyle: Pop+
R1ZL5CF8ZWKUSJ,B09HN4DHFL,5.0 out of 5 stars INITIAL PURCHASE REVIEW,Kiyarra Renee,5,"I'm writing this review having just received the product about two hours ago and carrying with me back to work. First thoughts and impressions:I love them! I love the color. I was worried they would be too bright of pink but its a pretty, just shy of bubblegum shade that I am thrilled with. (I love pink so this really made me happy). I love the compact design and at the suggestion of a few previous reviews I am going to try to fit the shell in to a soft airpod pro case for travel convenience. The attached charging piece is great! Although at first glance I was confused as to how to plug it in, it actually fits right into a normal usb charging port. Pairing was so simple with my phone. However, when I tried to connect them to my desktop, I couldn't get them to work properly but that's ok I have plug in earphones for that. I love that the touch commands are not super sensitive and pretty easy to learn and get the hang off. the sound is great for me. The buds DEFINITELY stay in place for me as advertised. I swung and shook my head around all over and they didn't even loosen up a bit! Cool!. They are discreet as well even with the bright color and I can wear one at a time so I can still engage with my coworkers when needed. For the first day, these are a win for me.","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2024",AEQJWQLSBNO6OPTLVPY6XHKLUP7Q,1,0,Color: PinkStyle: Pop

I'd give 10 stars if I could.,Amazon Customer,5,"To say these are a value based on cost is an understatement.Pros:Sound quality is very good.Call functions are excellent & easy to use.I use these while I work out & no issues with sound, having em stay in the ears or adjusting volume/pause/etc...Cost. I mean.... under thirty bucks is nuts.Battery Life: Far greater than my Jabras. I had these on for over 15 hours and still good charge.I have tinnitus, and these have background settings for sleep (Waves, Rain, etc...)Cons:Honestly, maybe the sound quality for calls is a bit less than Jabra, but not enough to cause any concern. I use during calls, Zoom, WhatsApp, etc... and no real drop in quality.My Jabra Elite's are over two years old, so would expect the battery life to be down from the original charge time, but the Jabras are over USD100, and cost vs quality compared to the JLabs is significant. JLab wins in all categories.I'm buying a back up pair before someone at JLab realizes they're underpriced.","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2024",AFDK6UMANX77MADSZLEBG76GRAWA,1,1,Color: BlackStyle: Pop+
R2EHK8KSVUWQFY,B09HN4DHFL,5.0 out of 5 stars Great purchase - holds up after over one year of use!,Reshma,5,"The media could not be loaded. I bought these in March 2023 when I needed Bluetooth earphones for my MacBook. I didn't want to go the AirPod route because I had heard it wasn't always reliable. Funnily enough, just today (about a half hour ago), I was supposed to have an online video meeting. The person I was speaking to was using AirPods and I could not hear anything he was saying. He often told me that the AirPods would get mixed up between his iPhone and his Mac so he ran into this issue a lot. He could hear me, but I couldn't hear him. He even turned his Mac's Bluetooth off to so he could rely on the built-in speakers. No luck. Maybe if he'd done that for his iPhone too but by then, we were 10 minutes in and decided to call it a day and meet next week. He messaged asking what earphones I used and I went back to my search history here and shared it with him. He said they'd be arriving today. I'll post an update on his experience once they arrive.Honestly, I could have written a generic review and talked about how I love the magnets, how I never have trouble hearing with them when they're fully/medium charged, how I love that each time I connect or switch between devices (Android phone / Macbook), I hear ""Ready to Pair"" and ""Bluetooth Connected, Battery full/medium"" or ""Low battery."" It's simply splendid. But I think today's scenario -- which made me actually want to write this review -- serves as a much more powerful testament to how good this product is to use.But sure, I'll follow what Amazon suggests under ideas (I've already covered Quality):Sound Quality: Excellent. Can hear so well, no background noise interferes.Stability: They are excellent and stay stably connected for a very long time (multiple hours)Buttons: Not relevant, there aren't buttons per seEase of use: I love the magnet that keeps the buds intact in the holder and the magnetic mechanism that makes me feel the closure is secure. Not to mention the easily accessible cable at the bottom that lets me charge them without having to hunt for a USB cord to attach to an outletVolume control: Pretty good with the touch sensors. I'm not that good at it, it's a swing and a miss sometimes. But I honestly couldn't care less about this because I have the option of adjusting the volume on the device I'm connected to.I've been using these with 0 issues since I ordered them in March 2023. I guess they might fall off if you go for a run but that's just asking for trouble anyway; find earbuds that sit on your ears with a cable connecting the two buds if you want to run and listen to something. Or use headphones.","Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2024",AHI3UQVIOYAUM67N6WHGBZNJEJ2Q,1,2,Color: SlateStyle: Pop
R2YEFDZO9LY7KQ,B09HN4DHFL,5.0 out of 5 stars BEST AFFORDABLE BLUETOOTH EARBUDS,jessie,5,"I’m not usually one to write reviews but I’ve had these for a month now and I’m absolutely obsessed. I got these on sale for about $18 in the Fruity Pebbles style about 1 month ago and I have a few points to share:1) I love that the Fruity Pebbles style gives my earbuds a bit of personality and pop of color without me having to buy an entirely separate case for them. If you want something more simple or neutral though, they have plenty of colors to choose from!2) The battery life on these is insane. I work about 25-30 hrs a week in retail and use these earbuds for 75% of my shifts. These came fully charged and I have not charged them once since receiving them in the mail A MONTH AGO. To spare you some math that’s between 75-90 hrs of charge. I’m speechless.3) The sound quality is surprisingly great. I’ve tried Airpods, Samsung earbuds, and other really pricey earbuds with pretty decent sound quality. These do the exact same for a fraction of the price. The only downside is that they are not soundproof, although I’ve found that a lot of brands advertising “soundproof” earbuds don’t actually deliver the soundproof experience.4) The charger on these is so cute and convenient. Even though I haven’t charged mine until now, the fact that the charger is already attached is an awesome feature. being able to forgo a separate cord and plug these straight into my car, computer, or other USB outlet will definitely be a life saver for me in the future.Basically, I’m hooked and will never even CONSIDER buying any other brand of earbuds probably for the rest of my life.

RMLSPAGIFCMQ1,B09HN4DHFL,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound,William T Ardito,5,"My previous pair of earbuds, made by Samsung, were getting very quiet and cleaning them did not change the sound quality. I had my volume turned up all the way and it sounded normal.I didn't want to spend big money on ear buds that would degrade over time, so I tried these out and I'm so glad I did.The sound quality is better than my previous ear buds. I now listen with my volume at 25-30% and it is crisp and full.The app works fine for me. I used it to shut off the touch controls, because I just personally didn't like those on my ear buds. I was also able to select the equalizer preset that sounded best to me.For buds less than $30, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.One gripe: the cord for the built in charger is very short, which charging just feel... Awkward? I have this case just dangling from the wall. I'd prefer a usb-c port like every other device in the universe so I can just plug my phone charger into it.

The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless, it literally takes seconds to pair to my phone.And last but not least, the battery life — wow. When you pair the Bluetooth it announces the battery life so you’re not guessing whether they’re dead or not.

The battery life is great even a year later. My absolute favorite feature is the integrated charging cable! Multiple times, my husband has forgotten his charger for his earbuds when we travel. Not me! It’s built in! I wish JBL’s smaller earbuds had the same feature but I refused to buy earbuds without an integrated charger at this point. I’m not great at controlling them with the touch feature but I think it’s just because I’ve never bothered to figure it out. I do have a lot of issues with the left one.

I'm just spoiled and a bit of a sound quality snob, I've historically used Bose. I still do for some applications. But I wanted a set I could leave at work, at the office. I didn't want to pay Bose prices for a second set. These earbuds appear to serve the purpose I wanted quite nicely. They're just not going to be the same sound quality as Bose because they're clearly a lower price point.

I’m not terrified about losing them like I was with the more expensive ones. They fit snugly (but not too tight) and I haven’t had any issues with them falling out. The only reason that I didn’t give them 5 stars is because I find them to be a bit difficult to remove from the case. I also don’t love how you charge them. It would be easier for me if you could just plug a cord into the case as opposed to plugging the case directly into the c block as the plug in attached to the case is stiff and difficult to pull out from the case. These are the only issues that I have with these ear buds.

R3C1E4RID4SDBR,B09HN4DHFL,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Enough,Catherine Green,4,"I'm not good at discerning audio quality, but these earbuds are ever so slightly worse quality than my expensive headphones. But like for the price, that's to be expected. They're good enough for when I don't want to use the bulky headphones.They also don't have a great range. They'll be fine if I walk across the room, but if I start going behind objects or down a hallway, the sound will start to skip a bit. But again, they're fine enough for the price. If you use them with your phone and carry it with you, they'll be fine.I saw someone else say these made their ears itch. Mine itch a bit while using these too, but my ears are sensitive. I only use 1 earbud at a time anyway, so I just switch them out for the other ear when it starts to get itchy after an hour or two. I think that might just be earbuds in general that do that, but I like that I can easily switch them out.I really like that they automatically connect when you remove them from the case, you don't have to turn them on. If they don't detect any paired devices, they automatically enter pairing mode which makes them super easy to use.The magnets in the case are strong and it's a bit hard to take the earbuds out sometimes.For the price, these are great. I hope they last me awhile.Edit: After 2 months, I still like these earbuds. I rarely have to charge them. Occasionally while using them with my TV, the audio starts getting choppy. Putting the earbuds back into the case to disconnect them, then taking them out so they automatically reconnect again seems to fix the problem. Again for the price I think they're adequate for me.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AFK53FA6BDBFPTFOUT66CQ4QLIFQ,1,2,Color: My Little PonyStyle: Pop

I was being kinda bummed about it having an attached USB cord but once I started using them it has become one of my favorite things about them. When I turned them on and added them to my iPhone fairly quickly and they continue to connect without any issues. Super easy. They fit amazing and come with different size ear pieces.

Easily connects to my IPhone, battery life is great both in the buds and the case, the double sided usb cable is convenient, and the case fits on that little mini pocket in most men’s pants. I’ve also dropped an earbud into a full cup while doing dishes and it survived being fully submerged in soapy water for 10-15 seconds without any issue.Cons: Very rarely the buds will have some issues cutting in and out from phone audio regardless of range, might be interference or something like that. The mic quality is apparently mediocre at best but I haven’t listened to it myself. The biggest issue I’ve had is I cannot get these things to reliably work on PC. I’ve tried many times to connect them to my computer and it either doesn’t give any audio at all or cuts in and out every 10 seconds or at worst gives an almost painful intermittent static. I’ve updated my computers Bluetooth drivers and done all the tweaks I can on the PC side to get them to work, but nothing has worked. I’m not mad at all considering the price, but these would definitely be 5 stars easily if they had reliable PC connectivity.","Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2024",AE7DPYNMWJQ3T7ZRDWV7TABFAZTQ,1,20,Color: BlackStyle: Pop

R39K1GBYYV4GIY,B09NDMBCRH,5.0 out of 5 stars best headphones I've ever had,Jillian,5,"This is my 2nd time purchasing these headphones. My first pair lasted about 4 years, and I only had to replace them because I dropped them a lot (I'm clumsy, they're actually very snug, and a solid design). They survived most drops, but after some drops on concrete I had a part break. The first 2 times I was able to repair it with super glue. They still functioned great! I think after the last time my repair lifted the piece slightly and one of them had trouble charging unless I was holding it. That's when I decided to replace them.The earpiece is soft and comfortable enough to forget you're wearing them, but also secure enough I would wear them when jogging or biking without fear of them falling off. The sound quality is great, not hollow or tinny, but solid enough you can feel the base. They're not soundproofing or anything, but you can't expect earphones to be. I think they get pretty close though. I would still need to take them out t hear and understand anyone talking to me.My favorite aspect is that the case charges while you use the earphones. It takes maybe an hour to charge the case to full. During that time you can be using the earphones as well. If they start getting low you can even alternate with one headphone charging at a time, so you are never without music.Given the average price for a good pair of headphones on the market, I find these to be extremely reasonable, and I would happily pay this amount every 4 years if that's how long they last. However, I think with better care (Ie: not essentially launching them at the concrete) they will last much much longer. That was the only issues they had in all that time.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AE5NFAXAX5INWA4PYU7UHODNAP6Q,1,8,Color: Blue
R2YC8T36LW540I,B09NDMBCRH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Really good, but has some issues",Michael K.,4,"So I workout and found my Google Pixel buds are not at all good for working out. These occiom earbuds are much better for working out. The around the ear works to keep them in place with moving around whether you are doing yoga, HIIT, elipiticals (which I've had my Pixel Buds pop out routinely during) or general weights.The ear hook does not feel uncomfortable which can happen with ear buds with the hoop. I work out with these for almost two hours, and there is no ache. And that is despite having a thicker than normal heft on the ear lobe.Charging is a synch. You just use the type-C cord that you have with your android and charge the case. The buds themselves have a rather long life. You place them in the case for maybe 20 minutes and they are ready to go again. Often times, I found the case was lower than the buds when i charged them and that the case is dead, not the buds.These are separate channel earbuds. They can work with only one in or both in. They are not that hard to use as a multi-channel earbud could be. I've had a few and they often lead to being able to get one earbud to work, not the other. These, the only issue is that you have to turn both off (I'll get into this later.)These are really good at canceling out noise. I honestly do not suggest using these in any setting other than working out or maybe at concerts or loud events as you cannot hold a conversation with them. Even Pixel buds, you could if you pop one out. You can't exactly pop out one of these though.Now for the few negatives that come with these ear buds. These aren't ones that I will rate 1 star for, but keep a 5 star product at a high 3/low 4. I already spoke of how good at noise canceling these are. Noise canceling is a double-edge sword and can be as detrimental as it can be helpful. These are too detrimental because they work too good. The next negative is how easy it is to lose them. I've seen other reviewers who drop them or leave them in their pockets or whatever and the next time they find them, they are broke if they aren't ever seen again. The ear buds do not have a ping back feature that can help you find them. I know Pixel buds, Galaxy buds and Earbuds do have that feature. I want to say Raycons do too and brands such as JBL, Bose and Beats can depending on the grade of buds. The last, is turning these off. These are one of the harder buds to turn off out of any earbuds I've had. You have to press and press and press for not one but both ears. Now I have had similar annoyances from similarly priced buds, but they typically had other issues namely battery life.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2022",AEXS3PVKKDYLQ3JQHPU4JEJ3PA2Q,1,105,Color: Black

Let me get the one con out of the way immediately:My pair have always come loose from the charging contacts if the case is moved around too much, so I can't just toss it in my bag.Aside from that, these buds have no right to be as good as they are. I've bought a lot of cheap earbuds and these are way better. The sound is honestly good. Obviously not audiophile good, but I've never had an issue enjoying bassy music or podcasts or whatever while cleaning, doing lawn work, etc. They don't come loose when I'm working and they are comfortable. The case feels cheap and I worry it will break, but I've dropped the case a couple of times as well as the buds and everything is still working great.No issues ever with pairing, the buds work great either with a single or with both. I've had two times where they desynced and I just put them back in the case, popped them out and they were good again.Highly recommend these. Get the green one like I did and everyone will think you're carrying a soap bar with you.","Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2024",AE7VARDZ5VJTLHZH6VMVN4N5RZSQ,1,19,Color: Green

R22XJ2U3TJO1NL,B09NDMBCRH,4.0 out of 5 stars Better than Beats?,Amazon Customer,4,"My first bluetooth headphones were the Powerbeats Pro. (They were a Christmas present, I wouldn't have gotten anything that expensive.) Since they were my first ones I didn't have anything to compare them to.Powerbeats Pro(Roughly 1 year)The beats were really cool at first, but ended up really finicky, were difficult to keep connected, I had to disconnect and reboot them far too often, would never sit in the case right so they were never properly charged, and the worst part was that I needed an app to use them. Because of the price, my stomach dropped every time they fell even a short distance. But I didn't know any better than to love them! Eventually they stopped taking a charge; eventually they stopped turning on at all; eventually the case completely died. Buying new ones was waaay cheaper than servicing them. They're in a box somewhere.Occiam(1.5+ years)After an absurd amount of research, I settled on these as a replacement. Note, I wore these all day, everyday. By which I mean 8am to 4 ish, then I'd charge them about half an hour, and then 4:30 until 10-11 or whenever I went to bed. They did get some water on them (not regularly, but at least once a week), and (maybe gross to hear, but) I do make a lot of earwax - my point is, I really wore these out.The price made the whole process less stressful. That was worth it.The sound was surprisingly good, definitely better than the beats (by the time that they had died). I really expected the $300 headphones to have better sound quality after 1 year than $35 headphones out the package. I was very pleased right of the bat. I used them for short phone calls, but nothing that extensive, so I have no opinion about the mic.The connection was iffy at times. They were reliable in that they weren't very hard to connect, but after a little while if I touched... like, possibly any item whatsoever, they would go out. Sometimes they would go out when I wasn't doing anything, but they would come back on about a second later. This didn't bother me because I'd had such a hard time connecting the Beats; I was grateful that they worked at all.The fit wasn't all that special. I got over the ear because my ear canals are small, I guess, and all kinds of ear buds always pop out - including these. (Even using with the smallest tips.) When they would come out, I would just push them back in. Since the buttons weren't so easy to press, this wasn't a problem. With the Beats, I would accidentally push buttons all the time. People complained about these buttons being too hard to press, and they're not wrong, but I just used another finger to support the earbuds or just pressed the dang thing in my ear harder - it didn't bother me.The interface I liked. You could use just one at a time, which I never did, but more importantly both earbuds had all controls so I could control them despite my hands being kind of full.The battery life was decent, but nothing I was too impressed by. Maybe 8 hours of play time - at first!Which brings me to why I stopped using them. At some point (maybe 6-8 months in) they would only hold a charge for 3-4 hours. Usually if there was a charging issue, I'd just clean the case and whatnot and it would be fine, but nope. No matter what I did they wouldn't hold much of a charge. This was a problem because I needed to block out my coworkers for at least 8 hours a day to keep my sanity. So I retired them as backups and bought new ones.My newest ones were bluetooth but connected by a wire, which has pros and cons. Recently the wire connection got messed up, and I turned back to these hoping that after 6 months of not even needing my back ups, these would mercifully allow me to bridge the gap to purchasing my next pair.Charged the case, popped them in, they work just fine.I haven't used them long enough to re-test the battery life.And despite the overall pleasant review - I won't be repurchasing them.Edit:(Week or so later)I tried two other headphones and I am going to get these again instead.","Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2022",AGCDWBQ6GU7ZNS2M4UPNTOBKXAIQ,1,235,Color: Black

R2SBEJN3ZWRZE5,B09NDMBCRH,5.0 out of 5 stars Lifetime Warranty!,AmazonFan,5,"Budget ear buds does the Job2.5 year Update: Licensed clumsy person here. Ended up running over one of my new ear bud replacements with my car. (I tend to drop earbuds everywhere and loose them for a period of time🤦) At this point I decided not to bother the company for a replacement due to my ridiculous nature.I can't get the single pairs to link up to one another BUT I am able to charge them in any charge bank simultaneously. I just have to click all ""T17"" names at once till one connects to my Bluetooth and just use one ear bud at a time which I've done anyhow in the past.Two year Update:So it's official I'm clumsy. I left the replacement pair in a pant pocket. I accidentally put my full weight into my foot and stepped on the ear bud while changing clothes. The ear hook broke off, signal got messed up (though later this fixed itself but it would fall out of ear without the hook). Contacted the company again and happy to say they came in clutch and replaced them.By the way, These earbuds have a lifetime warranty. Can't go wrong with trusting a company who will work with you, easy to contact, and will save you money in the end especially if your a clumsy person like me who can't afford to replace earbuds when budgeting.One year update:I've contacted the company when I started having issues with the charger bank and earbuds due mostly to (accidental drops/repeated accidental washes) Thankfully they were able to replace them and so happy with their their customer service! I've accidentally washed these earbuds before. One time a wash messed up one bud sound quality but corrected itself after leaving it alone in the charging bank for a few days. Both buds are still going strong.Wearablity: Won't fall out of ear but if wearing a facemask the buds entangle with the mask (one time accidentally sent a earbud flying at someone when untangling). I wear glasses and they don't get in the way except when paired with Glasses+mask+earbud= EntanglementBattery life: I tested the battery life while I used to work at a job site on a 5 day 24hr basis, by the 5th day the bank would need charging (I use one ear bud for each time I used them). Battery life is good, one bud will last a full day with spaced out use. Got into the routine of giving a bud a break and switch out buds in late afternoon/pre evening. I've taken these on a 3 day trip and a 2 day camp trip and never had to worry about charging the actual battery charge bank.Sound quality: Is ok, if using high volume sometimes (depending on song quality as well) the music may distort a tad and garble lightly but I like a medium low level anyways so its not an issue.Pairing: I've been able to pair my 2 Android phones fairly easily with these buds, but sometimes pairing can be stubborn so I just pop em back into the charger bank and start over OR turning the ear bud off then back on, usually it corrects this way.2 year Update on noise cancellation: These come in handy when at the library while there are loud people talking nearby or hearing someone loudly speaking on their cell phone in the next study room over. (Both earbuds in, irration replaced by good study music)Is actually too great and should be taken into account. When I have one ear bud in and the volume is loud enough I tend to miss out on someone trying to talk to me, so i like the volume med low so that way i at least have some awareness of my surroundings especially when out on a walk with my dog. I am able to hear my music while vacuuming on the highest volume though keep in mind that this can damage your hearing overtime if doing so on a constant high volume basis.Avoid using while driving, the noise cancelling feature won't let you hear sirens from emergency vehicles.","Reviewed in the United States October 20, 2020",AGVDZKL4FUVK2ROOGURRLN3Q2YTQ,1,52,Color: Black

R2QT75WLJER6N0,B09NDMBCRH,"3.0 out of 5 stars Earbuds not built for regular gym visits, but decent customer support",Nathan H.,3,"As someone who goes to the gym almost daily, I'd probably give this product a 1 were it not for the responsive customer support behind it.These earbuds, like a few others I've tried over the past couple years, CANNOT withstand regular athletic use for long, I'm assuming due to sweat seeping into the internals and frying something (despite being listed at IPX 5). I've bought this set of earbuds twice and the second time around the left earbud lasted only 2 months, as it would try charging but never actually hold this charge or turn on. This second purchase I had went through the short process of getting them registered on occiam's site, so I decided to follow up with them there and they promptly sent me a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement only got me through another 5 months as the right earbud went out, and they ended up refunding me the cost.Earbuds shorting out aside, I never had issues with the actual battery life. At worse they sometimes will come off their case's charging pins slightly if jostled and turn on to connect (pain in the rear if you use bluetooth for radio by the way, since my phone would jump from the radio bluetooth to headphone bluetooth). Sound quality and noise cancellation is decent enough for what you're getting, good enough for working out or other physical activities.So yeah if you regularly workout and work up a decent sweat, these will probably only tide you over for a brief period. For casual use it will probably last much longer. If you decide to buy or have already bought, make sure to register them and contact customer support if they bust (if you're okay giving them address info). Also worth noting if you're like me and have the original and replacement sets where one side dies but have opposite sides working (e.g. right earbud of original set still works, left earbud of replacement still works), you can pair the original and replacement earbuds that work together (or at least that's what I was told by support).","Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2024",AHW3MQEUJKXLJ3TXEAB7JJOCG5AA,1,4,Color: Black

R3G6XL7P7WNTBZ,B09NDMBCRH,5.0 out of 5 stars Third Time is the Charm!!,CLT,5,"Ok. I was using a different brand and I've had them for 6 months and now the right ear won't seat in the charging case without me having to jimmy-rig-it with a toothpick. I contacted that seller and they didn't ever get back with me. I would have just ordered another set but I didn't want to spend $65 on an item that only lasted for 6 months!I ordered another brand that had great ratings. Got them. Used them. Hated them. Why? Lemme tell you why I love these:First, longevity of these bluetooth headphones is pretty awesome. I sometimes work a 10 hour or 12 hour shift and I need them to last me that long to get thru it. I take lunch at 6 hours, put them back in their charger box and I'm good to go for the last 4 or 6 hours. Also, the other brand I was using before they stopped charging, had control buttons on each ear piece. You have a volume up and down button on the top of the ear piece itself and then on the side or outward facing part of the ear piece is a button for pause and play. It may have another function but I am unsure. The second set I bought did NOT have these features. You had to hold the outward button down for 2 seconds to increase volume, quick button push to pause/play and what if the volume was too high? I didn't know how to fix that.Second, comfort is also a key element. Everybody has different ears. The first day I wore these my left ear didn't like them too much but I wasn't ready to give up yet. It took me a couple of more days to figure out just how to set them in my ear so they were comfortable.Third, sound quality is pretty great! I don't listen to a lot of music (yeah I know I'm weird) but I do an awful lot of podcasts and audiobooks and if the ""readers"" sound tinny I don't wanna listen you know? Great balance. I need to be able to hear the low notes or tones and the higher notes sometimes. These are really rounded in sound. I like that.Fourth, cost. $40 was about my price range. I knew I didn't want to spend any less because the quality also goes down with lower prices but I also liked that I didn't have to donate an arm and maybe a leg for these.Fifth, I have yet to use them as a bluetooth connected to my phone for phone calls but I'm sure I'm going to like it a lot. I talk to my parents everyday on the way to work and hands free is essential and EVERYBODY should be hands free but I don't make the laws.My only complaint and it's really quite minor is when I take them out of the case and put them in my ear it takes probably a full 5 to 7 seconds for them to say ""CONNECTED"". One other thing: the earbud tips, they give you 3 different sizes but I prefer the memory foam ones and I have to remove them to get the earbuds back into the charging case. This is the only thing I would change if I could. Just a little more space in the case for different earbud tips.So A+++","Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2020",AEE7TBWREX6I6KDIDEK7RZNEEYYQ,1,21,Color: Black

R28Z96GHEWW4Q,B09NDMBCRH,3.0 out of 5 stars Short Lifespan - Great at first (updated),Justin Thompson,3,"I purchased these headphones about 8 months ago. At $20 for true wireless headphones to work out, I could deal with a few issues and still feel like I got a deal. However, one year into ownership and annoyances have become major issues that not only ruin my experience while using the headphones, but also ruin my experience with every bluetooth device attached to my phone.Issue 1: The right headphone stopped charging about 3 months into ownership and I have to listen in one ear. Using the supplied instructions, I cleaned the contacts with alcohol. This did help but never eliminated the problem.Issue 2: (Really an extension of Issue 1) The headphones ""autoconnect"" and ""auto-power up"" when they are removed from the case. At first, this seems like a convenient design. However, when the contacts start to intermittently lose contact with the earpiece, you will be driving down the road listening to bluetooth over your car radio and the headphones in your gym bag will ""auto-connect"" to your phone when you hit a bump in the road. You can manually reconnect the car radio, but the next bump you hit will auto-connect again! You can mitigate this by ""forgetting"" these headphones every-time you stop using them, but a physical power button would have been a much better design.Ultimately, I loved the low price and initial use of these headphones, however, they no longer charge reliably and just having them in the vicinity of my phone or other bluetooth audio devices causes constant issues due to random ""auto-connects"" to my phone. Unless you have a use case where this is not an issue, I recommend looking elsewhere.[Updated 06/09/2023]--> I have added 2 stars back to these headphones. I have found that in addition to wiping the contacts with alcohol, you also need to add a rubberband to the headphone case to maintain contacts. If you do both of these things, then it renders the headphones usable again. Still not a 4 or 5 star product because these are clear design issues, but it is no longer a one-star product. With these modifications, the headphones become useful again and don't randomly connect to the phone while driving in the car.However, I will also add an Issue 3 that has started occurring now that I work in a new location. At my new company, I believe we have higher electrical interference, because these headphones disconnect from one side to the other frequently. This also occurs when I am working with power tools (go figure). It is somewhat acceptable for $20 headphones, but still annoying sometimes.[Updated 6/26/2023] It turns out the new issue is not related to interference. These headphones constantly cut out and back in, with audio switching from one ear to the other. This is horribly frustrating and doesn't appear to be related to any particular situation. I have updated my review to 0 stars because this makes these headphones unusable. Twenty dollars originally felt like a good deal, however, to get less than 1 year of life with about half that time spent in frustration, you are better off getting a better set of earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2023",AFF6U6ZEWZ52MTXTRK4TR564ISAA,1,34,Color: Black

R11HJEV7XJYDDM,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for running and comfortable,Rick,5,"I typically run anywhere from 20min to 1 hour several times per week. I also sweat very heavily. To the point where clothes and towels are soaked.After trying half a dozen ear buds... The Sony c700n is the only one that stayed in my ear the whole time without falling. And they did so comfortably. The fit, comfort and grip is just phenomenal. It's almost as if Sony designed these for my ears. The default ear tips they came with the buds miraculously worked and I didn't even have to try the others.Some of the grip and stability is probably due to the weight of the buds as they are very light and sit very well in your ear.Flagship models are obviously fine but they have a huge disadvantage to runners since they are a lot bigger and heavier and therefore lose some grip and stability.The sound quality on the C700s is excellent as compared to my Galaxy Buds Pro 2. Honestly I can't tell the difference in quality. Even without the advanced codecs.ANC is probably where I see a difference compared to my Galaxy Buds. The Samsung ones are better but not by leaps and bounds. Id call the Sony c700 adequate and works sufficiently well at the gym to block most noise. With music on you won't hear any outside noise.Phone calls is an are where these struggled for me. I can hear other people just fine and clear... The issue is other people cannot hear me... Complaints I often hear is that I sound very far away and the noise cancelling for some reason does not work well during calls. Calls I made in moderately loud places were a near disaster. If you're in a quiet environment maybe they will work better. Hopefully they can fix this with a software update.I can't fault these buds though... I got them for sports/running and good audio quality... And for my use cases I am blown away! Especially at the price point.I prefer the push button interface rather than touch sensitive while running. This is because sometimes I need to adjust the buds without activating any commands. Touch sensitive earbuds are annoying for this matter. Sony designed the buttons well and they are easy to operate. It goes without saying that I can adjust the earbuds without accidentally activating any commands.The case could not be better for gym and sports. It is small, light and minimalist. Love the texture and they are small enough to keep in my pocket without noticing. Given the price point of the buds, I also wont mind if they get scratched of dented. The design is very practical and the ""rough"" plastic texture looks very nice to me.The app is very simple and works well. Besides software updates you can also adjust EQ to your liking. The app is very minimalist but gets the job done. I haven't explored the additional app features yet mostly because I don't think I have a use case for them.Buy these for the gym, very good audio quality and adequate but not stellar ANC. Do not buy these for personal or work phone calls.For the price, it is hard to believe the value these buds offer.","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2023",AGUBP7OHOLRD4H67LLYJZLHRWHFQ,1,95,Color: Black
R2B13J5B42HCX8,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars First Impressions,Whyborg,5,"Long time fan of Sony products. Have the WH-1000XM4, WF-1000XM4, and other brands. Just got these this morning and listening now. Pretty happy with sound quality, the Sony app helps as I like a punchy bass and have typical high frequency loss for male adults. Once set up with the app, clear bass turned up almost to max and treble up I’m enjoying the sound. Sounds very much like the WF-1000XM4. Noise cancellation seems similar but need to do more listening in different conditions. Got the XM4 reconditioned and unfortunately the right battery is failing to hold a charge after about a year and a half so got these to satisfy my earbud itch until the XM5 is released. Actually liking the push button as opposed to the touch controls of XM4. Not better, but not worse. A bit smaller which I’m pleased with as I like to sleep with audiobooks on. I can sleep on my side with a soft pillow and not feel very much pressure. Did have them pause as I have the right side on default to pause and skip but only once so far so I don’t think it will be a problem. Contrary to some reviews either side can he configured to volume with the app. I have volume on the left now. Single press notches up, holding lowers volume. Default is to switch between noise cancellation or ambient mode. I have cancellation on most of the time so volume is more important to me. Also saw criticism about them not automatically pausing when removing, not a problem to me as I can easily pause touching the right side button. I also have some QCY buds that were surprisingly good for the price, and Soundcore A40 witch were also a good find, paid $99 but now $79. They’re almost as comfortable as these for bed but protrude a bit further so when sleeping on my side more pressure on my ear than the Sony. So far noise cancellation on the Sony is the best, almost as good as the XM4.For the price, I think this is a very good alternative to the XM4. Battery life is rated to 7.5 hours and the Soundcore are rated to about the same but by early morning I get a rudely loud charging notification. We’ll see how the Sony last with similar use and update this review later. Overall in direct comparison of the XM4 I’d say these are just about as good but maybe not as broad of a soundstage. If you like Sony or are just looking for a good quality earbud with noise cancellation at a reasonable price these would be a good selection. One major improvement for me is the tips for the buds. I have large ear canals and the memory tips on the XM4 were a huge disappointment, they would not seal in my ears which is terrible for sound quality and noise. I keep all the tips from many earbuds over the years and even with other brands need to dip into them to find larger tips to seal in my ears. Pleasantly surprised the included large tips actually fit me. I included a photo of the Soundcore, QCY, XM4, and the WF-C700N for comparison. The WF-C700N seems to be the most comfortable so far. Slightly smaller than the Soundcore and definitely smaller then the XM4.So after using these about a month I’m still happy with them. I do have the occasional problem when listening to audiobooks in bed with the buttons for pause or volume getting just a little too much pressure and activating. Fortunately for volume one notch is louder but if you hold it the volume is reduced so at least I haven’t been blasted by max volume. Much as I like Sony products the other buds I mentioned would probably suit most people fine with a lower cost. But they’re not Sony! Still anxiously waiting for the soon to be released WF-1000XM5. Hoping for the lighter weight than the XM4 and the comfort of these with touch controls instead of push buttons. But for a mid-price bud these are still my favorites.Another update, these are not working for me to sleep with. My left ear gets a little raw spot on the edge of some cartilage. I’m primarily using the Sony WF-1000XM5 )got them 2 weeks ago) and the Soundcore A40 for audiobooks in bed. The headphones until my ears get too hot and the A40’s when I want to lay on my side.The Sony has some edge or something on it that makes a tiny little sore spot on the cartilage in my ear. Still like them a lot but now using them when I do my indoor cycling. I have a couple big blower fans on me and the Sony blocks out a lot of the noise and are better then the QCY I’d been using. They’re more rounded and I get less wind noise also.WF-1000XM5 just released, expecting mine Friday. I REALLY hope they don’t irritate my ear the way these do.So I’d still recommend these. It’s probably just my personal ear shape causing me an issue, no problem on the right side but nobody is perfectly symmetrical…8/523Update. Got the XM5 2 weeks ago and loving them. Fantastic sound, lighter than the XM4, better bass, more comfortable. But again the tips don’t fit. Airtight seal is critical on noise cancelling earbuds. The app is the same for The 700’s and XM5 but the 700’s do not have the feature enabled that checks for a seal. I discovered the left bud on the 700’s and the new XM5 just won’t quit seal. I found a hack to make the tips moldable. If you get Sugro glue (kind of like clay) roll a bit up, pull up the mushroom part of the ear tip, take the rolled up piece of Sugro and wrap it around the fitting to the bud, roll the tip back down and now you have a moldable tip. Insert in your ears and make sure they a good seal. You may have to reshape it a bit with your fingers if you work it too much. Once you have a good seal let it set a few hours and now you have a fitted tip. Works with my big ear holes…I have to reiterate, the 700’s have a very pleasing sound once you get the equalizer and clear bass setting adjusted to your taste. I just finished using them for 4 hours straight on loud during a 2 hour indoor cycling session, walking the dog, and making my lunch. Enjoying music I haven’t listened to for too long. They were comfortable (almost forget they’re in) sound excellent, and just put them away with 50% battery left.I really think most people would like these and would not be disappointed in any way, especially at the price. The XM5 are better, but to most people probably not $200 better (but I love them too!).9/22/23 a note about the app and the codecs used. I feel like a dummy now that I finally noticed right at the top in the headphone connect app it tells me on my iPhone it’s definitely using the AAC codec and shows if DSEE is on or not. DSEE definitely improves the sound. Compared the noise cancellation against the WF-1000XM5 and the XM5 do a better job with the 2 blower fans I have on me during my indoor cycling. But I still prefer using the C700n just because I want to be very careful with the more expensive buds.10/23/23Lost these! Looked all around but can’t locate. I was able to replace them @ $88 so not hugely upset, ordered a new pair and happy all over again. One of the reasons I really like these is how light they are. Even after 4-5 hours of wear I almost forget they’re in. Still one of my favorite pairs.Revisiting noise cancellation, walking my dog with light traffic only a few feet away I’ve had the chance with the new pair (left button default is now toggle ANC transparency off or on. With it off I’m not hearing much of anything but my music. In transparency mode I can hear everything around me. I’d give these a 9 from 1-10. About as good as any ANC buds I’ve tried.12/22/23Found the lost pair so now I have 2 pairs of the WF-C700n and not unhappy about it. These are definitely my go to buds, use them more than the XM5’s as they’re so light and comfortable and now at $76 I don’t worry as much about loss or damage as with the pricy XM5. If you haven’t tried them yet you should!","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2023",AEAYPV2TEKJARFBCJER62TJ37YMA,1,286,Color: Black

R1BK55UNS6YUGH,B0BYPFNW6T,1.0 out of 5 stars Quality and Warranty Concerns,Family,1,"This is an update. So, I have started the warranty process with Sony. Here is how it works. After I called Sony, I had to call them twice to get them to send me an email so I could respond with the information they requested. After I sent all the information in, I had to call them three more times to actually get the email so that I could return the product. After I mailed the product in, I got an email stating that they had received the product and it was being reviewed. A few hours later, I got another email stating they had reviewed the product, and they were going to replace them. The replacement was then mailed out 5 to 7 days later. It then took another week to get to me. So the total time for the warranty exchange with Sony was over a month. It also took multiple phone calls, extended wait time, and lots of time on hold. I know Sony makes reasonably good products. Especially at their highest end. Their lowest end tends to be garbage. The main problem is, they're customer service is also garbage. I think it can do much better with a different brand.I like the fit and how this system works. It is easy to turn on and off noise cancelation. When the noise cancelation is working well, it is very good. The right side started malfunction about 5 weeks after purchase. The seller does not help with this. I am trying to navigate through Sony for a warranty replacemet.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AG2CKXBIFWGIHL4FNAYWS3IFTKBQ,1,0,Color: Black
R1MGV1XOWJJUS5,B0BYPFNW6T,"3.0 out of 5 stars Decent Sound, ANC Not For Airplanes",Artie Deco,3,"These are not bad. They fit my ears well. They are reasonably loud, but they won't be overpowering.The frequency response is pretty good. The associated phone app gives you some equalizer control that helps, too.There is some configurability for the buttons. Not completely customizable, as the actions are grouped across numbers of clicks (e.g. 1: pause, 2: next track, 3: previous track are a group). But I like the defaults, anyway.I also like the tactile buttons. You rarely accidentally push them while adjusting the buds, unlike touch buttons. There is definitely a significant delay for them to respond (I'm guessing a lot of this is waiting to see how many clicks you're going to do to determine which action to take), so the actual mechanical click lets you know you've pressed them.They did not hurt at all, even on 9-10 hr flights.And the battery life so far is crazy good. With ANC enabled, they were still about 15% after use for those entire long flights. Without ANC, they were like 80%! (That'll likely change with age.)But, the ANC is not useful for me. I bought these for airplane travel. A very old set of ANC headphones did wonderfully eliminating the airplane noise. These, not so much. They physically seal well, so they block sound pretty well with no ANC enabled. In the airplane, turning on the ANC changes the sound, but seems to trade one you can hear for another at roughly the same volume. On one 9 hr flight, this was a bit preferable. But it didn't make much difference on the other. They also didn't block crying babies better with ANC than without. However, they were plenty loud to drown out that noise with or without ANC.The passthrough mode is functional, but poor quality. It lets though the ambient sound, but it somehow boosts actual noise. Airplanes have air blowing all the time. Without the earbuds, you don't really notice it much. But with these in & turned to the monitor mode, the hiss of the air is very loud. But again, it's still functional for listening, even while being annoying.As mentioned, I bought these for airplane travel. I have Google Pixel Buds that have no ANC. Comparing to these, the seal is better with the Sonys, even though the ANC doesn't do much for airplane noise. And the equalizer allows adjustments that the Google Buds don't. Including the battery life & buttons, I've decided to keep these. But just be aware of the ANC limits.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2023",AECD3NAKI2EFV3AV2WSRPK3ZRQFA,1,38,Color: Black

R54TAZM3P539,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars True ANR Nlise canceling,DD1550,5,"For those of you who want to purchase this product PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW. I'm going to try and make this short and accurate as possible. Many will tell you that the ANR noise reduction is just a bunch of white noise. THIS IS FALSE! This Bluetooth headset has two modes. ANR and a mode that is sort of a surround sound microphone mode. You can toggle between ANR and surround sound microphone mode with a single tap of the left headset button. You will know when you are in ANR mode because it will be very difficult to hear anything you are surrounded by while you have these headphones in your ears. You will also notice the sound of the music you are listening to is very sharp and clear with lots of bass. The surround sound micro phone mode helps you to hear the environment around you. They sort of turn into microphones and amplify surrounding sounds so you can hear them. This is too often misinterpreted as ANR white noise. Often when wearing these, you will get someone walking up to you talking, trying to communicate, but whatever they are saying will be inaudible if in ANR mode. If this happens, tap the left headset button once. This stops ANR mode and you will be able to hear them talking while still hearing music playing. For best results, tap the right headset button, it stops the music or whatever you are listening to. Then tap the left headset to get out of ANR mode so you can hear the person or environment you are in without removing the headphones from your ears. Its a really cool feature to have on these. The battery life is ok. My headphones will stop functioning at about 6.5 hours of use. Which is acceptable for me for the price. If 6.5 hours of use sounds ok for the price you pay for these, then get them. They are a good bluetooth headset for the money and DON'T LET THE REVIEWS WITH MISLEADING INFO BE A DECIDING FACTOR!!","Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2024",AHDOGFOOXLQ6SC2NVWODUFM4QRRA,1,16,Color: Black

R1QMGR8WHUBKMQ,B0BYPFNW6T,4.0 out of 5 stars Beyond Expectations for Budget Earbuds,Trenton,4,"I can be pretty sensitive to noise, so I've been looking for a good, yet affordable set of noise-cancelling headphones for a while now, but have always been wary of cheaper models. I decided to give these a shot after listening to Sony's C720N's, and so far I've been pleasantly surprised!Noise-Cancelling:What really blew me away was the quality of the noise-cancellation for the price. I didn't have high hopes given that I only paid around $100, but after using these for the past week I've been pretty satisfied with their performance. I would say these earbuds are really good at filtering out lower-end noise, like fans, traffic, and TVs as well as more distant sound. I walked past an industrial AC unit on my way to work the other day and barely heard the thing, especially with music playing. These don't really excel with dealing with higher-end or particularly loud noises like close speech, dogs barking, or sirens, but they do significantly lower the sound, which is incredibly helpful for me. Turning the NC on with music playing is usually enough to block out the majority of offensive noise.Audio:The sound is also really well-balanced right out-of-the-box with good low-end and clear mids and highs unlike the flat or muddy sound you might get with other low-price headphones. Sony's app also allows you to customize your EQ further to get a mix that better suits your preferences, which is really nice. Speaking of the app, you can customize what the buttons on each earbud do through it and toggle the Adaptive Noise-Cancelling setting as well.Comfort:The earbuds themselves are honestly pretty comfortable and fit in my ears snugly. I don't feel them come loose at all as I'm moving about, and I can wear them for hours at a time without much issue. I haven't tried exercising or running with them yet, though. I have been running into a bit of discomfort in my left ear after a couple hours of wear, but I think that may have more to do with the shape of my ear since my right side is fine. I've just been letting the left earbud sit slightly away from the ear for now. which has been helping mitigate any discomfort with out sacrificing any noise-cancellation.Battery-Life:I use my earbuds with noise-cancellation on for at least two-four hours each day. When I'm done using them, they go back into their case to charge. In the week since I bought them, I've only had to charge the case twice. For me, that's not bad at all. The case has an LED indicator to let you know when your charge is getting low, and you can also check it via the app. Charging only takes a couple of hours.All in all, I've been pretty happy with these. I think they're a surprisingly good pair of earbuds for the price. The noise-cancelling of course won't compete for Sony's top-end models, but these do the job and they do it much better than expected.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2023",AHQFE3IETHLN5VJGRSROS3ZIEGOA,1,36,Color: Black

The charging wire is very short, that needs to be adjusted by manufacturers. The app is necessary and gives you the life % of each bud and the case. You have to put the buds in your ears for it to connect and give the information. Weird but that’s how I got it to work. There are some other features but I chose not to use them.

RWT29BUJJGM1V,B0BYPFNW6T,2.0 out of 5 stars For the Money - Not impressed.,Granular,2,"I bought these earbuds to replace a set from a different manufacturer that started to not accept charge after around 3-4 years.First thing I noticed was the clunky application you are encouraged to download to make the most out of the ANC and Audio features. The product comes with literature telling you straight up - Made for Iphone/Ipad.. Works with Android - so right away, I felt a sense of dread because I'm an Android user.Through the setup process, you are asked if it's cool that Sony collects all of that sweet information about who you are, how you use the device, your mother's maiden name, etc.I clicked yes, because the audio without the app was on par with the 20 dollar set you can buy at the gas station. WITH the app, you are then asked if you want to install ANOTHER app that will make full use of the ""capabilities"" of the new earbuds you just bought.. for ~$100.. and that you MIGHT have to pay the digital audio fluffers a subscription to use their services. I declined this option and decided to see what the Sony app could do to digitally optimize the sound quality with what I assume are cheap and (too) small audio drivers.Long story short:-The bass is lacking.. seriously lacking - you have to turn the bass setting up to max to achieve what I would consider normal for an in-ear earbud.-The mids and highs are ok - nothing special about the sound.-The active noise cancelling is ok - probably better than the set it was intended to replace (but those were 4 years old.. and older model when I bought them)If you're going to spend ~$100 for a set of everyday use earbuds, I would look elsewhere. The set of Jabra Elite Active 75T's this was supposed to replace blow these away in terms of audio quality (no I don't get paid to write reviews.. yes I only write reviews when a product fails to meet my expectations).Unfortunately, I need these for work over the next few weeks - so I won't be returning them.. but I am VERY Underwhelmed.-","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AH7EAOWJE7ETS2SCSOQDAI7OBHEQ,1,0,Color: Black

I forget I have them in my ears after a while.Sound quality was fine. Different than the airpods, but I wouldn't say better or worse, just different sounding if that makes sense. Maybe a bit more light on the bass.The noise canceling was very underwhelming. Airpods really block out background noise, but with these, I heard everything around me the same way I do with non noise canceling earbuds.The price is clerly different and it's probably not a fair comparison, but if you're looking for anything close to Airpod Pro's, this will underperform.","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2023",AEH5LZ5VKPWO7L2A3L6NA7OBW34Q,1,3,Color: White

I have a few other noise cancelling products that actually make a lot of noises louder, or just give me a headache when enabled, but I actually use these earbuds as earplugs occasionally because of how good the noise cancelling is.

R3IFBNNEX7UUPZ,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars Very Impressive,Nick,5,"These are replacing my Lypertek Z3 2.0 earbuds which began having battery issues after only a few months.The sound quality for these Sony earbuds is incredibly detailed.The ""clear bass"" function is mind blowing.It isn't at all like a typical bass boost.This function is more like adding a subwoofer to your setup. The low end is more encompassing and punchy without ever compromising clarity and quality of the other frequencies.I was a bit concerned about the lack of frequencies available for the graphic eq but these concerns proved to be unwarranted as I don't need to adjust anything.These ear buds sound so good, I just leave the eq flat and adjust the ""clear bass"" function as needed for extreme music changes.These are my first noise canceling earbuds (as opposed to just noise isolating) so I can't compare to comment too much on the ability here but they definitely reduce background noise.The ambient mode is pretty handy when you need to hear what's going on around you.With the new software update, these modes (noise canceling, ambient, off) are switchable with a simple click of the ear buds (as well as many other customizable click functions).As well, the size of the earbuds / charging case is small enough to put in my jeans pocket and not be annoying or uncomfortable.I have only had these for a few days so I can't comment on longevity but so far, I am really enjoying these earbuds.There are a lot of features, amazing sound quality, high comfort level and all at surprisingly reasonable price point.

The loudness isn't. With the sound all the way up they're still pretty quiet. I actually needed to install an app on my phone to boost the volume, which introduces noise and distortions.

R2D95JSE3TO700,B0BYPFNW6T,1.0 out of 5 stars Will not enter pairing mode. Ever. Horrible instructions.,Verskate,1,"Update: Feb 2024 After having these for about 6 months, I figured out the pairing issue. It's hard to explain but it is done using the Sony Headphones app and disabling the option for connecting to more than 1 device at a time.New issue - charging. Actually not new, but every now ant then the earbuds just won't charge. You place them in the container, the light turn on and glows green, then shuts off. All the while 1 or both earbuds will be just about empty on battery life. So you have to play the game of removing them from the case, placing them back in the case, over and over. That doesn't work all the time either, so then you need to plug them into a power source and remove/place in the case until you get a solid orange light that doesn't disappear in 2 seconds. It's a pain in the a$$. Especially when you know the case has a full charge and you want to use the earbuds only to find out 1 or both are dead. Huge let down from Sony. Calling their support line, maybe I can get a different pair. These suck.Maybe I just got a bad set, but these are the absolute most difficult earbuds that I've ever owned. I've factory reset them at least 5 times and have wasted a good 2 hours of my life trying to pair 2 different devices. The instructions to pair a second device are to place the earbuds in the case, leave the lid open, hold the button on the back for 5 seconds. Sounds easy right? Nope. It's not. The buds will not enter pairing mode. Ever. I can connect to the first device, but good luck with the second. One thing I did learn when I was able to get two devices to pair, that one time, was to be sure to disconnect the earbuds from the first device. Besides the over-complicated method of entering pairing mode, I've had the earbuds only connect one bud, on a few occasions. So you'll get 1 bud to connect, and the other is dead. Trying to get them both to turn on was another clunky nightmare and I ended up just factory resetting them. I'm done messing with them, and they're going back to hell where they came from.UPDATE - If you're using the ""Headphone"" app on an Android and want to connect to ""pair"" with a second device. DO NOT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON SONY'S WEBSITE. They will only mess up your earbuds and make you frustrated. In the app under ""status"" locate the ""Connected Device(s)"" and tap that. The next screen you'll see a + button on the bottom right. Click that! That will put the earbuds into pairing mode.

So basically I have to tape them down EVERY TIME I want to charge them and even still one of them might not charge and yes I have cleaned the heck out of them. Another major issue is the fact they stay connected after putting them in the case so the battery will continue to drain. I have to manually disconnect them every time I put them back. Last thing, the case’s battery life is not very long. My Raycons case would last weeks at times(or it felt like) and the Sony case lasts like 2 days tops. As for the fit, it’s about mid level. I typically have a hard time finding headphones that won’t fall out of my ears(why I loved the raycon pros) and these are better than most but do manage to fall out once in awhile.These issues are a shame because like I said, the sound quality is great for the price and play time is great.

In my opinion, these are the best value. Like most Sony electronics, they're just a little bit better and more thoughtfully designed than the competition, in almost every respect, from the audio quality, to the crispness of the button press, to the way they snap effortlessly into the case, to the finish and feel of the plastics used in the buds and their case.The Jabras are slightly better acoustically and have wireless charging, but they're almost twice as expensive and have slightly less refined build quality. For example, the case is smooth plastic without any distinguishing notches to facilitate no-look use, and the buds are kind of confusing to put back.The Ankers are just great, too, but they're a shade less robust in audio quality and a little flimsier. For $20 bucks more than the Ankers, and almost $70 or so less than the Jabras, these Sony buds are the way to go IMHO.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2023",AEBZIZZHNUBQHOYRQLUT4LDRVNKQ,1,2,Color: Black

R1EQ8XNITZPB24,B0CQXG17RL,5.0 out of 5 stars INCREDIBLE Bluetooth Earbuds at a GREAT Price!,Casey Brett,5,"Unsurprisingly, Anker has done it again. These Bluetooth earbuds are absolutely incredible. I own over 30 Anker/Soundcore products and I swear by them. Amongst these products are two (well used) pairs of Soundcore Life P3’s. I love them because of the sound quality, volume level, size, and battery life. While browsing anker’s products, I happened upon these Soundcore Life P40i Bluetooth earbuds and I was immediately interested. Knowing the great quality of all of my previously purchased Anker products and, considering these P40i’s were on sale, I figured I couldn’t go wrong. Boy was I correct. These earbuds are amazing. Unlike other brands of earbuds I’ve tried, these things get loud; not loud to the point that you’ll hurt your ears or be unable to withstand it, but loud enough that you won’t be wishing you could turn them up more. The smart noise cancellation feature is really neat. I’m in construction so the noise levels vary greatly from day to day. The smart noise cancellation keeps up by changing the type of ANC. It’s really cool. Another feature I like and one that differs from the Life P3’s is the small little nub located on the earbuds’ “touch-control” zone. It’s very convenient. In addition, there’s an audible beep when you successfully tap for touch control which has absolutely zero delay. This is great to me because it confirms whether or not you actually touched the earbud. I posted a few side by side photos of these Soundcore P40i’s and one pair of my Soundcore Life P3’s because I wanted to know the size difference in the earbuds and the case and couldn’t find any reviews mentioning it or information elsewhere mentioning it. In case anyone is interested, the P40i’s case is a little bit smaller and the earbuds’ themselves are slightly shorter. It’s great because the P40i’s are EVEN MORE compact. The battery life of these is the best; bar none. 10h per earbud per charge. I have yet to hear the “battery low” alert. The addition of the phone stand clip within the case is ingenious and a new feature that I love. I watch lots of movies and tv shows on my phone. Now, rather than holding my phone, I can put it in the P40i’s case in front of me. It’s a small feature but works wonders for my use. Lastly, the sound quality of these earbuds is insane. There are enough preset EQ options to make everybody happy but it doesn’t stop there. You can go through the soundcore app to do a hearing test and create an EQ catered to your specific level of hearing. In addition, once you’ve completed the hearing IQ, you can tweak your custom EQ setting even further by adding a preset EQ on top of it, or manually altering it yourself. I’d by 10 pairs of these if I could. For anyone out there that’s even considering these earbuds as an option, just buy them already. You will NOT be disappointed. That’s a guarantee.

The connect really easy and the app controls are on the same level as their $100 Anker Liberty 4's which I also have. These earbuds I have used for a relatively long time and they are my go tos for school and work. The sound quality is great for the price as well as the bass which imo is better than earbuds in the $100+ price point. The mic quality is great and clear in moderately busy environments, I have gyet to test them in very busy. They are small and easy to carry around with you in your pocket and fit into any bad comfortable without taking up much space. As someone who is pretty busy to the work well in many environments, whether I'm in the gym working out or just chilling at my desk they are great, never fall out, and the anc works really well. If you're on a budget these are wonderfully versatile and just beyond great for the price.","Reviewed in the United States August 28, 2024",AFX32KOZO7T2H5QRZQVILMVM7JRA,1,7,Color: Black

Will try the p30i and still get the Sony xm5",Suburbanbushbabe,4,"Update 2 after Prime Day 7/20/24:Replaced with the p30i which are smaller and I'll keep them. They haven't fallen out of my ears yet. ANC is meh but Anker passive isolation is quite good. My issue is I'm just not used to wearing earbuds with those little tails. And the angle in which the Anker is going to my ears is a little weird. But like I said I'm keeping them. They're good.Did I repurchase the Sony's? Yes, I just bought the XM5 and I still think it's worth $170-ish more because of the sound quality. It's beautiful sound. Wind noise reduction is also better as is ANC. I haven't tried Bose so can't compare ANC. The p30i now my backup. You can't go wrong at this price. The sound quality compared to the Sony is flatter and thinner, but not like night and day; battery life and range are still quite good (I suspect battery life will be better than the XM5 for sure), and I still can multipair and have LDAC. I'll make do.Update 30 days later: I'm having problems with the fit despite trying different ear tips. I would love to get replacement ear tips but there are none available that fit this unique oval earbud shape. I'm going to give the p30i a try because it seems smaller and the reviews give better marks for fit. If I can get the Sony MX5 earbuds at a good price, I'll probably still buy them.Pro: sound, price, stellar battery life, multipairing, call quality, connectivity range, powerful volumeMeh: ANCCons: Fit and unavailability of better replacement ear tips; wind noise; controls (I cannot adjust the left earbud without the settings changing)After 8 months of wear, Sony's left earbud sound degraded to the point where I could barely hear it and the battery life has been decreasing pretty constantly. Very disappointing because Sony's sound is absolutely stellar. Sony couldn't replace them. So they're sending me a snail mail check refund and an RMA. These earbuds are intended to be a stopgap until I get the WF-1000MX5 replacement for the Sony's, which I bought on Prime day and will have to wait to buy on Prime Day again if I decide to go with the MX5. Because price.I just installed these (easy) and am having an initial listen right now. I'm quite impressed. I wasn't completely happy with the TOZO NC9. They sounded sort of compressed and not spatial. And the fit? I kept having to push them in my ears especially, the right one, to completely hear the bass. So the minute I started wearing these I filed a return for the NC9.P40i sound is heads and shoulders better. Aside from some faint scratchiness which I may be able to edit out, it's very impressive. Pretty good compared to the Sony too. They fit better in my ears even though they're larger and I'm not used to stuff with a tail on it. And Anker lets me use an app which I got used to with the Sonys. And I love the ear test in the app. It did improve the sound for me. I'm sticking right now with the original installed sleeves but there are four more to try.The test song I use for all three is Weird Fishes by Radiohead. It's a song that is not too bass, has really clear mids and crisp highs. The engineering really gives me a chance to appreciate the sounds because there are silences between them. It's really well produced for a fairly fast song. And it really pays to have something that really brings that out. You can't be muddy with this song. Even the NC9 was not muddy with that, but it was a little muddy with other stuff. Currently I listen to mostly K-pop boy bands, but I also listen to hip hop and pop music and EDM. And I will walk to Opera as well.I can't comment fully on the active noise canceling because I'm still in the house. And frankly the sound isolation is pretty good. I also found the sound isolation on the NC9 pretty good. This is a really early review so once I have a chance to put these through their paces I can edit for ANC and voice and video calls.What I'm giving here is my positive impression of the sound compared to the NC9. I love how these p40i sound. And let me tell you, the volume is strong. I have to turn them down, but continue to get the full range of sound.Controls? I have the same comment on the controls as I do with the TOZO. When I changed from ANC to ambient on the Sony, a voice would tell me. No beeps. I have a hard time getting used to these beeps to tell you the truth. Even when I had to change the volume, advance to next or back. there weren't these beeps: Sony just did it.If the Anker sound continues to impress me, the other features work out, and they feel comfortable and work well, I just may keep them instead of using them as a second pair with the Sony. I had also intended to try Technics AZ60 as a possible replacement for the Sonys as they're both multipoint, and Sony has LDAC (Technics may also have and be lossless, not sure). I'll wait for a while to see how these work out before I try them. And I have a month to decide about the Sony's.P40i is efinitely worth paying more for - not much more expensive, and vast sound improvement.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AGQSB2UVVFVR2PCSMSWU4QLLUSPA,1,26,Color: Oat White

I used to have AirPods Pro, the first gen, but after about 7 months of use, they completely stopped working, and would act up all the time.I just tried these and they are so comfortable, so portable, and last as long as I need for the gym, which is my use case.I have never liked in-ear products, but these are amazing!The only drawback for some people would be the mic on them, it actually really sucks, not in the way you would think though. It sucks in the fact that the quality is just really tinny, and going from apple to this, you can really tell the difference, but it still works, even in windy situations, people can still hear me, but my voice is just not HD.It’s like going from HD to SD for voice, but it still works, and I’m not cutting off even with wind and background noise, so it honestly just works, I think that if anyone is looking for a cheap alternative to AirPods, this is your best option, because it’s better in audio quality, and the microphone still works, just not HD.","Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2024",AGC54HAL5ZO6DAES3VOR52UPXPRQ,1,2,Color: Navy Blue
R2YAVDXK9M2LEL,B0CQXG17RL,3.0 out of 5 stars Acceptable for the price.,Ryan S.,3,"I lost one my of AirPods Pro, and wanted a cheaper replacement that fit similar and had ANC and transparency mode. It’s really hard to compare $50 earbuds with $200+ earbuds, but that is what I must do. These are an AirPods Pro competitor/copy in nearly every regard, from design, to the features implemented.PROS:+ they fit my ears a little better than AirPods Pro!+ Nice EQ options+ Has decent ANC I guess.+ Dual connections. You can have them connected to your phone and PCCONS:- Default flat sound profile is ATROCIOUS. No mids, extreme bass, and hissy high end. My custom EQ curve is nearly an inverse V to bring actual body to the music. Check my photo attached to this review to see the EQ curve. Even after setting a custom EQ curve, you can tell the drivers are just not tuned well. You can take out all the treble and there’s still this hissy high end.- Transparency mode is subpar, but your surroundings do seem to sound a bit louder in “vocal mode”.- I put ANC in the pro section, but I must put here that it doesn’t block out higher pitched sounds very well (like the high-end of the white noise an AC unit produces).OVERALL:After setting a custom EQ, sound is acceptable, maybe even better than decent, but not comparable to the AirPods Pro default sound profile. The bass is really there for those who love that, but I prefer a neutral sound with good mids, which is mostly achievable after some messing around with the EQ and setting an insane looking inverse curve. I like the dual connections, and the fit.I don’t know if I would recommend these for $50, especially with the absolutely horrid default EQ. I shouldn’t have to fight with that right off the bat to get a decent sound.There are other things I’m not really concerned with like color, size, battery life, etc, that I don’t have an opinion about.

R2PMTVFEFLMJF2,B0CQXG17RL,3.0 out of 5 stars Pros and Cons,Katelina Harris,3,"Cons- Fit- Noise CancelingWhen I bought these I was hoping they would be as comfortable as the other earbuds I have from soundcore. However, this was not the case. This gives me ear pain quite quickly, cannot wear them for very long without the outside of my ear hurting. I have never had a problem like that with any other headphones. I use the small earbud size and that fits perfectly. However, the outside of it, the largest part of the earbud is what causes me ear pain. It seems to be too large for that part of my outside ear. I do not recommend if you have smaller ears. The noise cancelation doesn't seem to work for me either, but I do think this is partly because it doesn't seem to mesh well with my ears. I can still hear quite a lot and I do have another pair from them that are NC but they work great.Pros-Variety of earbud sizes-Case life and earbud life-VolumeWhen I first opened the package, I loved the variety of earbud sizes. It did not take long at all to find the ones I needed. The Case life is also amazing, I have not charged this once since I bought it and it's on 50% life. Does not die as quickly as my other set does. The earbuds are also amazing, I have worn them for hours and haven't even gotten the low battery alert yet. The earbuds also charge quickly as well. The volume is amazing but it's not noise-canceling. I will say it is very easy for you to hurt your ears with the volume because it sounds more brash than anything. I have yet to experience any bass with them.Overall, I would not recommend these if you have smaller ears and are looking for NC.","Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2024",AEYRVEZDOHC5LOR265LGA5VLDKZA,1,0,Color: Black

RAFSXA5TP4G04,B0CQXG17RL,"5.0 out of 5 stars Works remarkably well for $50, Anker support excellent",Dr B,5,"The P40i earbuds work exceptionally well for a low-price product. Is it as good as a $250 earbud? Nope. But the sound quality is good and they do noise cancellation enough that low frequency sounds become (to me) inaudible and loud mid-range sounds are only heard faintly. Someone with a higher pitched voice speaking loudly is audible but just barely. With music playing I can't hear the person speaking at all. My painfully loud vacuum cleaner is perceptible but quiet enough to enjoy music or a podcast.An audiophile with a discriminating ear probably won't like the sound quality, regardless of the equalizer settings (which are very flexible). But most people will find the sound quality good enough, as I do while doing various activities like vacuuming, working in the shop, etc. - times when I don't need audiophile quality. I'll use high quality earphones or speakers in a quiet room when want to do serious listening to music.Customer support: Right out of the box, the right earbud had an annoying, crackling sound. Not very loud, but unacceptable. I called Anker and left my number for a call back. Within an hour, Erin returned my call. She was polite, knowledgeable and had a can-do attitude. After giving her the Amazon order number and serial number from the box, I described the problem. I also told Erin that I had done all the things their website suggested to correct it, to no avail. She said they would send new earbuds and took my address. As she promised, shortly thereafter I received a confirmation email from Erin who said to contact her directly by email if I had any further issues or questions. **** The new earbuds arrived the next day **** and they work perfectly. I'm amazed!I'll post again later if I encounter problems with the earbuds. For now, Erin and Anker get an A+ for service, and the earbuds do everything I need.7/9/202 Addendum: Well - almost. I just tested phone calling using the P40i with an iPhone SE. Sound quality OK on the receiver (my) end but the person on the other end only hears my voice clearly if the earbuds are set to normal. The sound is garbled and fades in and out abruptly for noise cancellation or transparency modes - even in a quiet room. So I can't have a phone conversation in a noisy environment where I would like to use noise cancellation. Otherwise my review (above) stands, and I would still buy the P40i.","Reviewed in the United States July 6, 2024",AESCPB53OVI36YQP76OA3ELBPZ6A,1,9,Color: Navy Blue
R3PX7JXZF3VF8W,B0CQXG17RL,2.0 out of 5 stars Awful Soud in a Pretty Package,Yet Another Amazon Reviewer,2,"I'll go into greater detail below, but if you just want the short version: these sound so bad that none of their other features can redeem them. The drivers are so poorly tuned that almost nothing sounds good when played through them, and no amount of EQing or App trickery can fix it. I'll be returning these as soon as possible and continuing my search for earbuds.Dear Reader, I also tend to disregard most 1- and 2-star reviews because people have a tendency to be overly dramatic or blame products for their own technical misunderstandings, but please heed my warnings and do not trust all these rave reviews about the P40i's great sound quality. It takes a lot for me to say something like this, but those people straight up do not know what they are talking about.These earbuds were outright painful to listen to. They're obnoxiously bright and harsh, and the ""thumping bass"" promised in the marketing is more of a throbbing mud. To make matters worse, the default ""soundcore Signature"" setting (EQ) configured fresh out of the package sorta sounds like a simulation of the second week of a nasty ear infection, or maybe a migraine headache; maybe both at the same time.I tried tweaking settings in the companion app for nearly an hour to get a tolerable sound out of them, but they're legitimately unsalvageable. Based on the way the ""HearID Sound"" hearing test adjusts the EQ, Soundcore are very transparently trying to compensate for a complete lack of sub-bass response by boosting 100–200 Hz and hoping the overwhelming resonances in that frequency range will make you forget you're not hearing anything below about 70 Hz at a decent relative volume.In all of my testing, I ended up turning the 6.4k and 12.8k EQ bands down as low as I could inside the app (±6 dB maximum boost or cut per band, of which there are only 8, and their frequencies cannot be adjusted), and the treble response was still far too bright and grating for my ears.Cymbals sound ear-piercingly sharp, as does vocal sibilance, and every recording I listened to had an unnatural airy-ness that I never got used to. Bass guitar is a huge bummer, as you hear some notes at such a high volume that they drown out the rest of the mix, then others (mostly the ones on the low E string) almost completely disappear since the frequency response below 100 Hz is all over the place.The sound of rock music was so terrible I was curious how they'd handle other genres, but I almost laughed when I tried listening to something purely electronic. House music or Drum and Bass kinda sounds like going to the club with your head in a fish bowl or something.They don't even sound good for spoken word stuff! The sound of a podcaster talking in the general direction of an SM-7B with no post-processing is unbearable through these earbuds. It's all plosives and sibilance even on well-produced podcasts and videos, and every voice sounds nasal and irritating.It's clear the drivers are where costs were cut to bring these down to their $50 price point. Everything else is pretty good, actually. (I did not test microphone quality because I'd given up on them before the thought of trying to use them for a phone call even crossed my mine).I like the case, the transparency mode works well, the touch controls are limited to a part of the stalk that prevents a lot of accidental presses, and even the little phone stand tab is a neat touch. There are a total of 5 different sizes of silicone earpieces in the package (from XS to XL), so I was able to get a perfect fit in both ears. I went with the purple color option, and I think the shades they use look even better in person than in the photos; they're very pleasant to look at! Pairing was a breeze, connection quality seems good and stable, and I didn't experience any stutters or dropouts in my limited time with these.But again, I cannot emphasize this enough, they sound *so* bad. It seems irresponsible for a brand as big as Anker/Soundcore to put drivers this bad out into the world. As someone who mixes and produces music, the idea that people who buy this are hearing something so awful is upsetting, and the thought of anyone ever hearing and judging my own work through a pair of the P40i earbuds is legitimately offensive.","Reviewed in the United States August 25, 2024",AGALNNO2JBBB2P45Z2RLG7AJ4JEA,1,2,Color: Purple

They paired up easily, I opened them up in the app, updated the firmware and set my button controls. I did change the tips for a slightly better fit.

Based on their excellent customer service provided and potential future product/design improvement, I have raised my rating from 2 to 3 stars. I will be updating this review to either 4 or 5 stars as soon as improvements are made. Thanks for reading.***Original Review***Expected Better, especially for costThese ear buds get an average score. Let's focus on the bad, then move into the good.The bad-The P40I earbuds are the same price as Anker's over ears Q30, but definitely cannot out match them in terms of performance, sound quality, loudness, phone calls, and noise cancelling. They do not even compare. We are paying the same price point basically for the convenience of the smaller size, and being able to fit the P40I in our pocket. - While the over ear Q30 head phones are priced fairly, (Don't get any ideas Anker) with less performance and less materials needed for manufacturing, technically these earbuds really should cost less than it's over ears counterpart. This is a big negative for me. Next, when synced to two devices, if you are playing music from a PC and change the EQ from the app on your phone the song pauses each time, so if you are trying to balance out a song and try and select through the list, the song will pause for each selection, very annoying if you go through the whole list the song will pause over 10 times while trying to dial in the sound. Also, you can only have 5 ""favorite EQ modes"" in your favorite list at a time, I cannot understand why they would restrict you to a ""top 5"", we should be able to have as many as we want.Additionally, while the added phone mount is definitely a plus, and I will get into that more on the positives section, Anker has really goofed up in regards to using this with the app. This is because the mount requires you to mount your phone horizontally. Which is fine. However, when you go to use the Anker app, to adjust a setting, app only works vertically, which makes no sense whatsoever, because of this, you have to keep removing your phone from the mount to use the app. (Please fix this Anker.) Can't use mount vertically, phone will fall over. Also, while you can make adjustments on the buttons for music, which is a win for the ""good"" column, you can't adjust volume quickly because if you tap too fast it is considered a double or triple tap. (Anker, the solution for this, please add a setting for bigger volume up volume down increments) also, you can't adjust the button settings for calls, which also makes no sense. Noise cancelling is decent for earbuds, but is not perfect like their over ear counterpart. You will still hear noises only at a reduced level. Another downside is the widget which only assists with noise cancelling modes, which most people will not need because they will stick to one setting, yet their are no widget settings for EQ, which is used way more. It would not be hard to add a button for EQ to the widget menu. Speakers will blow out occasionally at max volume on certain songs.The Good:In terms of earbuds, these are definitely more comfortable to wear than most others, good choice of materials, and the location and use of the tap controls makes sense as you are less likely to accidentally press them when making adjustments, unlike some other types of tap ear buds which can be annoyingly too sensitive to even use. Sound is clear and the EQ is nice. Changing the EQ settings definitely makes a difference in terms of the overall user experience. Example: podcasts, to various genres of music, to audiobooks, etc. Also, it is a huge benefit to be able to customize your own button controls. You can select between 1x tap, 2x tap, 3x tap, and press and hold, for each ear. The mount is a nice added bonus, and has a rubber texture on the bottom of the case to prevent sliding when mounted. Noise cancelling works decent for earbuds, but not perfect like the over ear headphones. Connectivity is good and responsive and you can pair to two devices at once. Mount feature is a nice bonus for watching media. Battery life is great.Conclusion: at the end of the day, these ear buds really should not be in the $60 to $70 dollar range. A good price for these would be $30 to $40 dollars.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2024",AESFTKZ74FILXZQIUEG2ZAWLVD3A,1,24,Color: Navy Blue

Again my issue is that I discarded the package too quickly otherwise I would absolutely return them. Normally I have found products from this vendor good but not this one.

I am an audiophile (I know everyone says that, but I truly am in an almost neurodivergent/savant way), and I am constantly looking for particular preferences in earbuds. I have a mohawk, so banded headphones are out of the question, relegating me to in-ear style earphones. I look for 5 things - good volume (many headphones have puny, unimpressive, tinny volume levels, which pisses off this person since I've been exposed to loud music all my life and am probably half deaf by now); deep, accurate, and clear bass (no fuzziness); a good fit and seal (my ear canals are shaped like an alien's, so this is a big deal), a good charging case; and the ability to connect to more than one device (I often use my laptop and cell phone simultaneously and need to be able to hear and speak using both devices for work), and these little guys fit the bill and then some! Not only that, but they have a ""locate my earbuds"" feature for those of us that take one earbud out and forget where we set it down or lose it in the couch or bed (yep, I am guilty of this constantly) in the app, and the app well exceeded my expectations when it comes to features and options.

Of course I tried the manual EQ and it basically ending up the same curve. Shocking to me at this $54 on sale price point really, comparing to my Sony WFs. Noting I. This price range compares or comes close, feels like a $150 value for a third the price.The fit is almost unnoticeable sitting in my large ears, very lite feeling no weight at all sitting in the ears. I was concerned during my running how they would fare.The bad:First knock is the stock ear tips are not gripping when sweating during a workout, they slipped out while I was lifting weights in the gym and that was annoying. I went for a 30 min run and I had to keep twisting them until they felt like there was no loss of air seal to get the same sound while just sitting. Once I twisted them to the tightest position they more or less stayed put for every ten minutes before I had to twist them back.I cannot find a Comply foam sport ear tip replacement as that is what I typically use. Hopefully there will be one available soon.Update: I looked up the measurements and found the AirPods Pro gen 1 &2 Comply ear tips have a similar fit, and I took a chance and ordered them and they seem to fit the 10mm inner nozzle oval. They don't click on but after a little bit of wiggle they just stuck without popping off the nozzle end. They create a nice seal, sound better and hopefully do well on my runs without falling out.","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2024",AEIZW464HQPS3EJBV4FRUM3ZOSEA,1,2,Color: Black

R1E20F1D7C0WSE,B0CQXG17RL,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Airpods replacement,aklouie,5,"Needed to replace my Airpods Pro and didn't want to pay the $90 per bud to fix a blown out speaker. So I went searching for an alternative. These sound MUCH better than Apple's buds with a deeper bass and fuller sound overall. Pairing-wise they don't connect flawlessly like the Airpods do, but it's maybe 5% of the time I need to manually tell my bluetooth to connect, so it's forgivable. Calls sound good and the noise-cancelling microphones mean I can do house chores without the other person thinking I'm at a construction site. Battery life is way better than the Airpods Pro. I can go a whole day or long car ride without needing to charge them in the case. Some gripes though. The manual doesn't say so, but these buds are compatible with the Soundcore app on the iPhone even though the buds aren't listed as being compatible in the app description. The app is great. You can customize tap functions and adjust the EQ. Just wish the manual mentioned something about it. These buds also fell out of my ears while running, but that could be just the nature of this design (the Airpods did that too). Overall, I'm happy. They're a quarter of the price of Airpods Pro and they sound better and last longer. That's a win win for me.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AFDGJMWPJYDVRSMW6SI2PJ2TJG4A,1,6,Color: Black

Other controls such as wind noise reduction and immersive experience are also included. What impressed me was the sound-such rich tones. The noise cancellation works well in everyday situations.

R18WPBJRM84BJQ,B0CQXG17RL,5.0 out of 5 stars Even better than the pricier competition. Love them!!,Trillian,5,"I am a long-time user of Samsung's Buds Pro earbuds. After some allergy issues with extended use, I went looking for something else. I cannot believe how much happier I am with these Soundcore buds. First, unlike the Samsungs, they actually stay snugly in my ears, even during long periods of wear, and they are incredibly comfortable. They have several of the same features found in the higher-end Samsungs:* Toggle between noise cancelling and letting ambient sound through* Hearing test to customize the sound to your level of hearing* Find your earbuds feature* Battery indicator on the app* Sync nicely with the video on my tablet (no lag like some others)What I LOVE about these that is unique is that the Soundcore buds have a little raised switch on the earpieces that you can custom set for 1, 2, or 3 presses for different features. It's easy to locate and very easy to use. You can also listen to just one earbud while the other is in the case.I have not used these for calling features, so can't speak to that, but these have been great for watching movies and listening to music. I've managed to connect them to my phone and tablet separately, and have had no issues switching back and forth. The richness of the audio is incredible and the noise-cancelling features are almost too good. (I once left the kitchen faucet running because I couldn't hear it at all.)One thing these do not have compared to the Samsung's are the directional sound you get when watching videos. (if you turn your head from the screen, the Samsungs adjusts the sound so you feel like it's coming from a single place). That wasn't a dealbreaker for me at all, but FYI.I find I am using my earbuds about 10x more with the Soundcore buds than I ever did with the others. I highly recommend checking them out.","Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2024",AGRMHEMFCTKJ6WDZ6NM3OQVJ3IJQ,1,5,Color: Purple

I personally can not recommend them for the typical $100 they are no air pods. if you can get them for $60 or less they are definitely worth a shot. The noise cancelling is nothing too impressive I do like the app sound profile though it is a nice touch. The app is a bit frustrating when you are looking to change some settings of the earbuds quickly. When I first got these there was a new update for the earbuds whenever I would open the app. If you do not have the buds updated when using the app you can not change the sound settings until you update the earbuds. It would appear the updates have calmed down a bit though.,"Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AEBTJCB5W6IINB7PESNIGDRKPDRA,1,0,Color: Navy Blue

The app control is also quite good but the home screen widget on android absolutely sucks.

Ocupaba cancelación de ruido efectiva, bajos profundos y sonido nítido pues me gusta la música, pero sobre todo comodidad para usarlos más de 8 horas diarias, pues mis JBL ya tienen un año de uso intensivo y antes de que dejen de funcionar buscaba un buen reemplazo. No me arrepiento y los recomiendo, buscaba unos Skullcandy raíl anc porque me prestaron unos y me gustó como se escuchaban,pero me tope con estos y empecé a leer las reseñas, principalmente de usuarios que, como yo, ya han usado varias marcas y saben que el precio no asegura nada.

R1Y2VGRFAYI0Y3,B0CQXG17RL,3.0 out of 5 stars Worth considering at this price point,J. Blattman,3,"Re-writing this after a month with the product. The summary is: not as good as premium offerings (such as Pixel Buds or Airpods) but at 1/2 the price, worth consideration.The most important feature to me is noise canceling. At best the NC on these is weak, which was disappointing considering how much it's hyped in the literature and one of the main reasons I picked them. Sometimes I'm not sure if it's doing anything and I find myself going into the app to see if was turned off accidentally. At times it cuts out for 10-15 seconds. The app has many different NC configurations: manual, ""adaptive"", different levels, outside mode, indoor mode, ""customized to ear canal"", and so on. I haven't found one of the NC settings that makes a difference in how the NC sounds / feels. I'm convinced this model doesn't actually support the NC settings and it's for some other Anker headphones that uses the same app.The second most important feature is battery. Battery life is very good. I see 12 hours or more on a single charge. That's not counting recharging in the case, which adds another 2-3 full charges.The third most important feature is bluetooth multipoint (aka multi device). This is important if you use your headphone on multiple devices (computer + phone, e.g.). It doesn't work on these, AFAICT. I have to go in and click ""connect"" on the second device before it works. On my Pixel Buds, it automatically switches back and forth depending on which device is sending audio.I am not an audiophile and I'm happy with ""good enough"" sound quality. These are definitely average. I've never noticed them sounding especially good, or bad. You can see from pictures that this model has the ""horn"" sticking out, like Airpods. I'd assume it has to do with a sound chamber to enhance bass? I can say the bass on these is not any better that ""bud"" style models without the horn. If I could go back I would have purchased the bud style. The horn just makes it much easier for them to get caught on things and knocked out of your ear.The rubber tips on these always get flipped inside out when I pull them out my ear, which I have to resolve before getting them into the case. A small annoyance.The app allows you to map function to different tap actions. Want to triple-tap on the right bud to raise the volume, and tap + hold on the left to lower it? Sure why not. It's fine, but also I think it'd be fine to just pick something that's reasonable and forgo the complexity.","Reviewed in the United States April 24, 2024",AGM5DIAROF4K7LEQWOUX35BYG4NQ,1,4,Color: Black

While I like them, I was missing some functionality, especially being able to use them with more than one device at a time. I saw a great review for the previous version of these earbuds and when I was checking it out, Amazon notified me that there was a new model. After reading the specs, including the great battery life, I decided to give them a try.I love these earbuds! The sound quality is so good. I get so much more bass than with my old buds and more than I would think you'd be able to get on such a small device. They also have noise cancelling which makes the music sound even clearer. With the app, I can customize the controls and even switch the functions from one bud to the other. They are really responsive and recognize the control taps with no problem. The app also has modes you can set for immersive sound for movies or playing games but even the standard setting makes your music sound really good.Case has a magnetic closure and keeps the buds secure. The buds have a great battery life (12+ hours) and since the case can hold another 60 hours of charge, you won't need to worry about them running out of power. The case can be charged wirelessly or with a USB C cable. They come with a big selection of rubber ear tips so you should be able to find a comfortable fit.

Soundcore P40i by Anker!I have struggled with finding quality audio for customer calls, not looking like a gamer with massive headphones as I have to have camera on, and the ability to deal with the always unpredictable sounds coming from a kiddo over here. :) But, we fully tested a mess of options, did zoom recordings, staged a bunch of the ""normal"" sounds and verified that NO hooping and hollering came across on the recording. This is the winner (Soundcore P40i by Anker) - there was ZERO hint of any loud exclaims or claps or stomps, talk about a gamer changer!","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AEK3OK7ZO3NHG3VFVL5OVQVCRLSA,1,1,Color: Black
